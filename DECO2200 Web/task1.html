                <span class="header_gradient"></span>
                <p id=problem_text>
                  Did you know that <strong>every Australian State/Territory has at least one major hub/casino </strong> that supplies access to racing, gaming and lottery? (APS Review Paper, 2010) What about how these very machines play into the
                  innate
                  human psyche in which an unpredictable pattern of rewards and outcomes, to engage <strong> an intrinsic psychological engagement? </strong> How about the fact that this intrinsic psychological conditioning is licenced in the design
                  to
                  form an addictive 'hook' for problem gamblers? (Australian Institute of Family Studies, 2019)
                  <br><br>
                  It is these facts that forms the crux of what <strong> 200,000 Australians </strong> deal with per year, uncontrollable gambling addiction (Guardian, 2017). Our problem area of <u> gambling and addiction </u> is a $12 billion
                  industry
                  (see Graph 1.1,  ABC News, 2018) which upholds the financial burden of pubs and venues. Venues like Returned Service leagues thrive off the poker machines, as seen with Chatswood RSL generating <strong>$28 million dollars off
                    their
                    poker machines in 2017
                  </strong> (Chatswood RSL Club Ltd Annual Report 2018).

                  This area surrounding problem gambling is riddled with misconception and abandonment. Statistics show that <strong> 30-40% of problem gamblers have a coexisting substance dependence </strong> and that <strong> 50-60% of problem
                    gamblers
                    smoke </strong> (APS Review Paper, 2010). Problem gambling and addiction is a sensitive area that is also a networked problem. Intertwined in this problem are aspects of mental illness, learnt and intrinsic behaviour, contextual
                  factors and the machines themselves, all playing a role into discovering this problem area.

                <h2 id="part1-2">Problem Scenario</h2>

                <div class="problem_scenario">
                  <p id="scenairo_text">
                    Its not far stone to throw to see the injustices done in the sphere of gambling and addiction. A refinement of the scope of study has to be considered due to the external limitations that we faced from the very first
                    consideration of
                    this research.
                    <br> <br>
                    Due to the long history of gambling and casinos, which with comes a multitude of laws and regulations, the removal of casinos from the scope of research was clear. One clear hurdle that would be impossible to jump is the restrain
                    casinos would give to our research. This is due to the hierarchy of management and, due to the nature of our research, restrain for regulations to be installed within the casinos are only natural.
                    <br> <br>
                    Whilst considering this hurdle, we came across a statistic:<div class=quote>
                  </p>
                  <svg id="quote_icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="200" height="200" viewBox="0 0 24 24">

                  <p> Of the 241,000 worldwide poker machines that are not in gaming venues, this being pubs and clubs, Australia holds 183,000 of them. That’s 76% of the worlds non casino machines in our local communities. (Guardian, 2017)

                <p id="scenairo_text">
                  To put this quote into perspective; this 76% of pokies in the local community has given pubs in suburban areas a lifeline. A lifeline that is based on addiction and turmoil of an individual. To give perspective; The Railway Hotel
                  in
                  Lidcombe, a family run hotel, was the second-highest earning pub for pokies in 2016-2017. They earnt $13million, which averages to $250,000 a week. They paid a take cut of $5.7million, however still pocketed $7.3mil from local
                  residents
                  putting into the pokies. (Sydney Morning Herald, 2017).
                  <br> <br>
                  From this, a clear scope of research is made. By acting on a local level, our group decided we could make a wider and more impacting effect by targeting pubs, clubs and other non-gaming venues. Moreover, by gaining community
                  traction and
                  showing the injustices of pubs being propped up by profiting off an addiction, a wider impact to controlling the addiction based from this club level

                  <p>
                    What was very evident from the start of individual research was the wide pool of knowledge and research that the psychology of addiction within gambling already had. <strong> This guided me towards to creation of a research plan
                      and the curation of my first 'round' of research questions. </strong> The research report established key areas of concern that, in hand, could curate a design solution. The questions were curated in conjunction with my group
                    members problem areas (that being the venue and interface of gambling enabling addiction) in order to make sure all areas of this wider problem scenario were covered. <strong> Through this collaborative work, the final pool of
                      research is more targeted and aligned into creating a better design solution as we all know that each base of the research is covered. </strong> I elected to take the psychology aspect of gambling, whereas Eden took the venues
                    and Miguel took the UI of the machines.
                    <br><br>
                    My specific questions are stated below;
                    <br><br>
                    • How does treatment of gambling in the face comorbidity/co-existing conditions alter the rehabilitation of problem gamblers?<br><br>
                    • What is the line between casual and pathological gamblers?<br><br>
                    • How do the environments of Australian Bars and other gambling contexts enable psychological triggers for pathological gamblers?<br><br>
                    • What systems are in place currently to minimise access and enabling of pathological gamblers?<br><br>
                    • What is the main psychological trigger that brings patients to the clinic?<br><br>
                    • What measurable outcomes are currently in place to track and maintain problems gamblers into remission?<br><br>
                    • How does a relationship between the release of dopamine and gambling factor into enabling problem gamblers. <br><br>

                    These questions were established through a means of literature review (a methodology that will be justified later in the methods section) and form a basis around the APS Gambling Working Group's report on theoretical models that
                    play into the psychology of gambling. The findings will be looked at later in to findings and interpretations section, however, these research questions fall upon industry approved theoretical approach. <strong> This was done in
                      order to gain benefit later in the research process as I could be more well informed and use scientific and psychological theories in my interview questions with people who work within this field; </strong> such as clinical
                    psychologists and counsellors. Moreover, it allowed for the pool of my research to be more technical in its content as questions were framed in the medical approach learnt from these theories. This, thereby, could produced more
                    accurate findings that could adapt the final design solution to encompass medically approved theorems.


                  </p>
                  <h2 id="part2-1">Methods</h2>
                  <p>
                    Following the creation of this research plan, the clear next step was to undertake was a series of research methodologies that would, in hand, create a pool of research that could be analysed and understood later in the design
                    process.
                    <br><br>
                    In a general sense, the methods start from a very broad view of the psychology of addiction and gambling. Thereby, with every new methodology introduced, the research became more targeted and specific to this field of the
                    psychology of gambling within the problem scenario. By doing this, I was able to capture a wide amount of information and not miss on any aspect of the problem as I was able to get a general sense of the problem area and hone on
                    specific areas of concern.

                <span class="header_gradient"></span>

                <h2 id=method_justifs> Research Method and Justification </h2>
                <p id=mindmapping_just> I begun my exploration of research and needed a way to be able to visualise the 'subsections' behind the psychology of gambling addiction.
                  By breaking apart this large problem area, it would allow me better hone in specific areas to
                  research into with my later methodologies. Hence why I chose the methodology known as Mindmapping.
                  <br><br>
                  <img id="image_intro_method" src="./img/mindmapping1.jpg" width=300px height=300px alt="This is an image." />
                  Mindmapping is a tool, as defined by the Cambridge Dictionary,<strong> "A type of diagram with lines and circles for organising information so it is easier to use or remember". </strong>
                  Moreover, Mindmapping, in design and research, uses a central image
                  with a major main theme, then uses interconnected key words and images to branch away from this central idea/'node' (Kalyanasundaram M, 2017)
                  <br><br>
                  On an academic level, Mindmapping was chosen as it promotes <strong> "attentiveness" </strong> to this topic area and allows individuals, such as myself, to better <strong> "understand the concept". </strong> Moreover, mindmapping
                  enables designers to "deal with large
                  amounts of information and… retain an overview" rather than deal with the information purely mentally. ( Kalyanasundaram M, 2017). This technique informs gives application to be able to sort all presumed knowledge of the psychology
                  gambling. Design Think Make Break Repeat states "as [designers] are often dealing with large amounts of information which makes it difficult to retain an overview". (Tomitsch, 2018)

                  <h2 id=method_find> Findings of this Research Method </h2>
                  <p id=mindmapping_just>

                    This methodology formed the outline of my research as it broke down the psychology of gambling and addiction into distinct main sections. These four distinction sections , as seen in the figure below, were:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> "Why do these people start [gambling]? </li>
                    <li> "What is the treatment for [gamblers]?</li>
                    <li> "What enables them to gamble?"</li>
                    <li> "Why do they keep gambling?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p id=mindmapping_just> This breakdown of what needed to be covered within the psychology of gambling provided a loose scaffold to inform later steps in the research methodologies. For example, by breaking down the wider concept of
                    the psychology into clear distinct sections, it allowed for the Literature Review section to have more targeted and useful information come as a direct result of mind mapping. As stated by Kalyanasundaram, it formed a "nodal
                    structure that branched away from this central idea" of gambling addiction. Overall, it allowed to explore the concept of the psychology of gambling and delve into what makes up the whole field of enabling addictive gambling on a
                    psychological level.

                  Following an exploration of the chosen problem area, a clear divide has to had to occur in order for us to effectively cover all bases of this research. Taken inspiration, and readdressed for our needed use of the tool, Stakeholder
                  Mapping was the clear next step for the group to take. It entails a methodology of being able to <strong> visually represent a divide of work and people within a project. </strong> The divide of 'influence' (aka: what contextual
                  and internal factors have the highest impact on problem gamblers) allows all members in "a project team to understand who their stakeholders are" (i.e: what factor they focus on in the development of an eventual design
                  solution).(Kennon, 2009) Please see attached figure of how we were able to visually represent

                  By knowing who are major stakeholders were in this topic area, we were able to triangulate all our primary research in order to <strong> create a better, more cohesive design. </strong> This would also allow us to gain a pool of
                  information for later assignments from three individual topic areas.
                  By having three individual pools, our datasets we can pull examples, inspiration and direct evidence from will be <strong> more rich than us focusing in three completely unrelated fields </strong> that when brought together do not
                  compliment each other. Thereby a stakeholder map incentivizes this divide within the group into specific fields and stakeholders in the sphere of problem gambling.

                  Following the mind mapping and stakeholder sessions, this next stage had to give ground to the specific areas outlined above that came as a result from the mind mapping and stakeholder mapping sessions. Thereby, the next logical
                  move had to be a Literature review as it would promote a <strong> "firm foundation for advancing knowledge" </strong> in the psychological sphere of gambling. Moreover, it would also promote <strong>"independent theory development,
                    closure of areas where research has occurred and uncovers where research is needed" </strong> (Webster, Watson, 2002).

                </p>

                <h2 id=method_find> Findings of this Research Method </h2>
                <p id=mindmapping_just>
                  A Literature review is the survey of scholarly articles in relation to a specific topic area or issue. It is done in order to provide a generalised oversight of different sources. By doing a literature review, it also,
                  simultaneously contextualises to myself <strong> how my research fits into the wider field of study within the psychology of gambling </strong> (Fink, 2013)

                  A literature review of published journals and textbooks allowed for the reframing of key sources. It does this through by allowing me, following a wide overview in the Mind mapping stage, to be able to summarise and synthesize the
                  key findings in academic texts in order to this topic area. It also allows myself to come to a conclusion based on reading up on both <strong> old and new interpretations of a topic area and synthesize this into my own argument and
                    view. </strong> (Webster, Watson, 2002).

                <p id=mindmapping_just>
                  This method produced a wealth of information that had basis in all four fields established in the earlier mindmapping sessions. However, as assumed with any research project, it also opened up <strong> new avenues to explore within
                    the scope of the research. </strong> The following insights below provide insights into what was learnt throughout this formative part of the design process.

                  Moreover, an acknowledgement of the breadth of literature review has to be made. Due to this area of study being sensitive to many individuals, literature review proved to be <strong> where the wealth of my information and
                    understanding came from. </strong> This allowed me to bypass individuals that could be <u> triggered or angered by the questions </u> asked in later methodologies in interviews. <u> I was still able to gain similar insights
                    through this methodology as it accessed a pool of people that professional researchers had access </u> to by other means, due to their high credibility in this field.

                <h2 id="outcome-header"> Mental Health and Gambling </h2>
                <h3 id="outcome-subhead"> <u> Key Findings in this Section </u> </h3>
                <p id="mindmapping_just"> Pathological Gambling was recognised as a clinical disorder in <strong> 1980 and was introduced into the DSM </strong>(Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) (NSW Parliament, 2014)
                  This enabled a scaffold for <strong>classifying and identifying problem gambling by using diagnostic criteria.</strong>
                  This criteria is recognised in court and it provided a <strong> common-use language for clinicians to communicate and understand problem gambling.</strong>
                  This also opened the field to research and to understanding how problem gambling occurs and how to treat it. <br> <br>
                  A human's intrinsic motivation to gamble is based within the field of prospect. This is what promotes problem gambling. This prospect falls under the heading of <strong> excitement generation over the idea of being able to win
                    large prizes </strong> (usually of some monetary value).
                  For problem gamblers, the <strong> "motivational strength" for this desire to gamble is difficult to control. </strong>
                  This is due to their constant need to uphold this level of arousal and motivation to succeed in winning this prospect of a prize. (APS Review Paper, 2010).
                  This is clearly evident in theories such as 'chasing a loss' - this is where a gambler takes larger risks (usually with bigger or more bets) in hopes to undo a streak of losses. (NSW Parliament, 2014). This depicts a clear
                  motivation weakness where they simply cannot walk away from the machine.

                </p>

                <h4 id="outcome-subhead"> <u> Discussions of the Findings </u> </h4>
                <p id=mindmapping_just>
                  By starting my academic dive into this wide topic area, it proved helpful to start at a very basic level; <u> why do people gamble? Secondary to that; why do some people form into problem gamblers?</u>
                  By knowing of this intrinsic nature that promotes problem gambling, one can make the clear connection between psychology and what makes up the mental persona of a problem gambler.
                  <br><br>
                  This finding can inform later research into the models that disclose why <u> this motivational 'strength' to control gambling is harder to control for problem gamblers, over someone such as a casual gamblers.</u>

                <h2 id="outcome-header">Major Theoretical Approaches to Problem Gambling </h2>
                <h3 id="outcome-subhead"> <u> Key Findings in this Section </u> </h3>
                <h3> Learning/ Learnt Behaviour Theory </h3>
                <p id="mindmapping_just">
                  By the use of positive and negative reinforcement, the illicit and innate human response of an emotional response can condition a person to associate a certain action with a certain feeling. (APS Review Paper, 2010) (Dickerson, M.
                  1993)

                  <ul> Gambling formulates this behaviour by conditioning winning and losing to form specific emotional reactions by a person. </ul>
                  <ul> Winning, in gambling, is repeatably associated with positive gambling-related environmental cues, such as the lights and sounds by the machine, and the winning of a prize usually of monetary value.</ul>
                  <ul> With this conditioning, it results in an exposure of arousal and excitement (APS Review Paper, 2010)</ul>
                  <ul> By this conditioning, a person then associates the feeling of excitement and arousal immediately with winning on the poker machines.</ul>
                  <ul> Learnt theory, in gambling, also plays into the concept of the "random ratio reinforcement schedule". This is where the use of unpredictability of wins and where the next level of excitement will come thereby formulating a
                    persistence of playing on the poker machine (Haw, J. 2008)</ul>
                </p>
                <h3> Cognitive Modelling Theory </h3>

                <p id="mindmapping_just">

                  Cognitive modelling is a theory that there is a connection between the distortion of memories and cognitive capabilities and probability. (Gobet, 2011)
                  <ul> It bases itself under the banner of misunderstanding experiences of random outcomes due to a distortion of reality. </ul>
                  <ul> This results in false assumptions and relations between problem gambler's behaviour towards the treatment and control of their gambling addiction</ul>
                  <ul> Cognitive Theory is based under four banners in the gambling sphere (APS Review Paper, 2010). These can be seen below.</ul>
                  <ul> Illusion of Control: Addicts falsely inflate their abilities in influencing the overall outcome of games of probability</ul>
                  <ul> Ritualistic behaviour to influence the outcome of the game: Cognitive superstition that ones behaviour before, during and after the game can influence the outcome of the machine.</ul>
                  <ul> Selective recall of memories where favourable outcomes have occurred: This forced association forms the attention to be on winning the game and the skill involved in such.</ul>
                  <ul> Expectations of winning after a series of losses. </ul>
                </p>

                <h3> Addiction Modelling </h3>
                <p id="mindmapping_just">
                  The addiction theory is self explanatory, in which that a gamblers exposure to gambling and winning can promote an urge to more. Through frequent participation, <strong>their overall control of the amount they gamble ceases and
                    they have to undertake the activity to feel 'normal'. </strong> (Dickerson, 2006)
                  Moreover, there is a effect that dopamine releases a 'high' for gamblers and it is this high that transfers into reinforcing the behaviour of a gambler. (Robinson, 2018)
                  This high also plays into gamblers who even experience a loss at the machine. It promotes the idea that the gambler will <strong> 'chase the loss' ie- for every loss he experiences, he/she will make up the losses with an upcoming
                    win. </strong> (Clark, 2007)

                </p>

                <h3 id="outcome-subhead"> <u> Discussions of the Findings </u> </h3>
                <p id=mindmapping_just>
                  This massive leap in findings proved to position where the theories of where problem gambling innately stems from. This allowed for a contextualisation and a deep dive for where the current theories lay for problem gamblers
                  psychological triggers. By knowing the three main models, it laid a groundwork for a few of the main concepts of the research.
                  <br><br>
                  There is <u> not a single identifiable feature that makes up the personality of a problem gambler, </u> as seen with the different theoretical approaches listed above. A problem gambler is a <strong> manifesto of differing amounts
                    of internal judgements based on their own psyche. </strong> This can be within the scope of the three theories listed above, but goes well beyond that.
                  <br><br>
                  Each problem gambler is an <u> <strong> individual who has different internal and external contributions that have lead to this addiction. </strong> </u> The enabling of this addiction, on a psychological level, is formed through a
                  conjunction of theorems above and their own internal and external consequences.
                  <br><br>
                  This change in approach to the research due to not having this 'atypical' persona of a problem gambler due to the number of different factors that formulates a person's gambling addiction.
                  <br><br>
                  This begs the question that can be answered through primary research; what are the commonalities between problem gamblers?

                      Currently there is no generalised treatment schedule for psychological treatment of gambling.

                      Moreover, there is currently a <strong> single accepted school of thought that is involved in the intervention of gambling. This being total abstinence. </strong> This used to be viewed as the only viable and acceptable
                      criteria to measure success on a gamblers wellbeing
                      • It is the most common outcome when we address reducing the harm of gambling on individuals
                      • For some problem gamblers, the retainment of the motivation to gamble for some is difficult because they simply enjoy gambling as a hobby (APS, 2010). This, thereby, introduces controlled gambling. This is where they manage
                      their level of gambling to the amount of a usual casual gambler.

                      Treatment, as of currently, has to also consider the impacts that <strong> gambling has in the face of pre-existing/coexisting illnesses the patient may have. (also known as comorbidities) </strong> (Petry, 2005) This is found
                      impact current attempts to reduce gambler's harm to themselves and others within treatment. This complicated field has to consider the substantial hierarchy and value the effectiveness on treatment itself when multiple
                      disorders are all co-dependent on each other. (Welte, 2001). <strong> By treating gamblers who suffer from multiple conditions, it is up to the practitioner to make a measured assessment on which condition to treat first to,
                      </strong> overall, reduce the gamblers harm to themselves and others.

                  <p id=mindmapping_just>

                    By following up from the previous findings, ie: "what makes a gambler cognitively be enabled to gamble" - the clear next step was to see what <u> available information there was on reducing the effects of these problem gamblers,
                      as seen above. </u>
                    <br><br>
                    This summarisation of research forms the crux of what treatment is available for gamblers. Due to the broad spectrum of treatment strategies there are to treat gambling addiction, further first hand research will need to take
                    place to solidify key strategies psychologists use in daily practice.
                    <br><br>

                    However, one key takeaway learnt from this finding is how Dickerson states <strong> that there is no generalised treatment for gambling. </strong> This adds to the argument that differing internal and external factors can
                    attribute to a gamblers condition. <strong> <u> Thereby, if there is no generalised treatment for gambling, there is not one atypical persona for said problem gambler. </strong> </u>
                    <br><br>

                    This finding altered the path for the research and proved to be a key finding. <u> The research question of: "what is the line between casual and pathological gamblers" is simply not as clear anymore. </u> The line, in one sense,
                    becomes more of a spectrum in which different external and internal factors can contribute to pushing someone into the problem gambling sphere. However, for each different problem gambler, there is not one factor that can set
                    them apart from the next.
                    <br><br>

                    From this, careful consideration has to be made on the future of the research. This eventuates down into one question that has to be asked in interviews; <strong> "Who is are these problem gamblers and why are some people more
                      prone becoming addicted?" </strong>

              <p id=mindmapping_just>
                Once again, as linking with the previous section on treatment, this research solidified the concept that there is <strong> not one atypical persona for a problem gambler. </strong> Not only is this shown in treatment, but it has been
                documented in research paper as a key concern for current methods used to define and treat gambling.
                <br><br>
                This clearly known issue formulates a wider concern within the sphere of gambling; <strong> <u> how can treatment truly be effective if the heuristics in use to define a gambler are outdated and not as effective as they used to be?
                </strong> </u>
                <br><br>
                By not updating the recognition with current research of what makes a problem gambler, we cannot truly help with treatment of these individuals.
                <br><br>Moreover, without acknowledging these theoretical insights, <u> any generalised preventative method will not address key aspects that enable problem gamblers. </u> Thereby, there is a pull back from clinicians to implement
                current research into defining a problem gambler in treatment. Moreover, more research is needed in order to create a generalised solution that addresses these heuristics in its design.

                <span class="header_gradient"></span>
                <h2 id=method_justifs> Research Method and Justification </h2>
                <p id=mindmapping_just>
                  After this wealth of information that was found during the secondary research, primary research had to be put into action in order <strong> to contextualise all this information. </strong> However, before delving into interviews,
                  the next step was clear; <u> I had to see problem gamblers and their actions within the scope of the gambling room at pubs. </u> This meant seeing the patterns of behaviour and picking out this 'illusion of control' and 'enabling
                  of the gamblers psyche' theory on real individuals. This would allow me better understand the theory from a tangible angle and, thereby, help to prove this new route of theory I was pursuing; <strong> "On a psychological level,
                    what internal and external factors motivate a person to become a problem gambler". </strong> Moreover, this leads into the concept of "How do I attempt to create a generalised solution to solve gambling addiction when the
                  addiction itself is paradoxically very unique to a gambler's psyche?"

                  <br><br>
                  Naturally, a consideration has to be made for the privacy issues of observing these people, not to mention to backlash local hotels would have to an everyday university student attempting to rehabilitate their biggest and most
                  profitable customer.
                  <br><br>

                  Considering this, by making myself a 'fly on the wall' in this situation, it would prove to give me the results I need whilst not inhibiting these people's choice to gamble. This brought up the concept of "Space Mapping (also known
                  as mapping space). Mapping Space methodology entails "the bodily movements within space and time" (Tomitsch, 2018). It enables a form of interest as it <strong> "gives connections between the infrastructure and the individual
                    users" </strong> (Tomitsch, 2018) This allows for a mapping of behaviour within a space of these problem gamblers. By using this method after the Literature Review, it will allow me to contextualise all the behavioural psychology
                  learnt in the readings. This grants me the capacity to pinpoint the enabling of gambling in these venues.
                </p>

                <h2 id=method_justifs> Description of Methodology </h2>
                <p id=mindmapping_just> Mapping Space works by immersing yourself in the space and drawing an outline of the venue. Following this, you trace different people's trajectories in the space and note down key variables of the day. This
                  can include time, day and description. (Tomitsch, 2018) After repeating this process over a defined length of the day, certain patterns emerge that can dictate different behaviours and actions within the space. (Paay, 2009)

                <h2 id=method_find> Findings of this Research Method </h2>
                <p id=mindmapping_just>

                  As seen with the figures below of Pymble Hotel on a Friday throughout various times in the day, there is commonalities that need to be addressed. Mapping within a space is used to show innate behavioural patterns for individuals,
                  which can be seen through detecting patterns of movements within a space.
                  <br><br>
                  The commonalities of movements between the bar, purchasing alcoholic drinks, and the gambling area (which occupies at least 40-50% of space within the bar) can be seen through all four individuals mapped. This could suggest a close
                  relationship between alcohol and gambling. An important connection can be made, which forms the scaffolding for the findings of the one the research questions; How do the environments of Australian Bars and other gambling contexts
                  enable psychological triggers for pathological gamblers?
                  <br><br>
                  This question is once again on a spectrum and will need further clarification. There is a known correlation between gamblers and other substance addiction, as mentioned previously in this report. <strong> By the bar providing ample
                    amounts of alcohol to these individuals, it suggests that the Australian local pub scene is an enabling environment for gamblers. </strong>
                  <br><br>
                  This can also be seen with the Individual #2 that was mapped <u> who went to the bar twice and did not pay at all for the drinks he received. </u> This further suggests that the pub is enabling the gambler by supplying him with
                  free alcohol. By doing this, it lowers his inhibition and raises his confidence in his gambling ability. Thereby, <strong> this rise in false confidence through the special treatment </strong> at the pub can attribute to the
                  cognitive modelling theory and an illusion of control.
                  <br><br>
                  However, we cannot assume all of these things, investigative research is needed. I followed these mapping sessions with going up to the bar and asking to interview the assistant manager of the hotel for a quick contextual
                  interview. This is so I could ask for his interpretations of the findings I explored above. Key findings pulled from this inquiry were standard pub statistics such as: "Probably around 50% [of people here come] everyday". This
                  insight does further develop this ritualistic behaviour some problem gamblers have. It also suggests that these individuals getting cheap/free drinks are said regulars.
                  <br><br>
                  <figure class="image-container">

                  <img src="img/indv2.png" alt="This is an image." width = "500px" rotate = "180deg" />
                  <figcaption> Individual Two </figcaption>
                </figure>

                  However the most interesting factor is what the owner of the pub didn’t say. When I posed the assistant manager with the question:
                  <div class=quote>

                    <p>"For the 30 minutes I've sat in the bar, I've seen the same gentleman come here [to the bar] and get a drink without paying and he happens to be getting them and taking them back to the gambling room. Do you see him often and
                      is that a loyalty program for regular patrons" I was told that the interview was over and I was escorted out by the security of the hotel. </p>


                </p>

              </div>

              <br><br>
              <p id=mindmapping_just>

                Now this can <strong> suggest this the acknowledgement of the management of its breach of RCG and enabling of gambling. </strong> This also could indicate a connection between the research question involving the enabling of problem
                gamblers within the pubs. This is an interesting insight as it acknowledges that,<strong> due to gamblers providing the backbone to many finances of hotels and pubs, pubs are knowingly enabling gamblers and giving 'special treatment'
                  as they keep the hotel alive. </strong> By digesting this finding, we can also link it to the likes of having minimum systems to maintain access of gambling for pathological gamblers. <strong> By having the poker room in close
                  proximity to a bar which serves alcohol (a substance that reduces inhibition), hotels are playing into the psychological enabling of these gamblers. </strong> Moreover, this access to gambling systems proves that there is simply a
                minimum attempt in preventing access to gambling for these individuals with a problem.

                <p id="mindmapping_just">
                  Using interviews, or more specifically semi-structured interviews, was the clear next step in finalising both secondary res found earlier in the research process and the primary research found in the mapping sessions. By
                  being able to <strong> "discern background information" </strong> about this specific problem area we are able to gain <strong> " concrete information about their existing experiences " of problem gambling </strong> (Tomitsch,
                  2018).
                  <br><br>
                  My specific aim from interviews was to gain very personal, first hand insights around the problem area. By using the semi-structured interview style, my aim was to be able to probe into these unique first hand findings. This, in
                  theory, would result in <strong> very rich and personal insights by the interviewee due to their first hand experiences of working within the sphere of gambling and addiction. </strong>
                  <br><br>
                  In order to gain this information I need, we have to form a collection of interview participants that can fill this field with the type of information wanted.
                  <br><br>
                  First hand insights into the psychology of gambling clearly leads us to the people who treat gambling addiction. This would include <u> clinical psychologists, psychiatrists and general physicians </u> as they clearly have first
                  hand engagement with these types of patients. Moreover, <strong> they can inform me of my current information gaps within the understanding of how we define a problem gambler. </strong> One clinical psychologist and one councillor
                  was used in this interview set - they were Christopher Hunt from the Gambling Treatment Clinic at Sydney University and Law (her first name was not given) who is a gambling councillor that works for the mental health department at
                  the Royal North Shore Hospital.
                  <br><br>
                  Moreover, first hand experience within the field of enabling problem gamblers will be needed. This was addressed in some degree at the mapping stage, however to get clearer insights into the first hand experience of enabling these
                  problem gamblers, it would clearly come from gambling attendants in these pubs. One (anonymous) gambling attendant was used in this interviewing set
                  <br><br>
                  Finally, a mix of both fields is an ideal candidate but naturally very hard to procure. One candidate was used who was from Gamblers Anonymous. He wanted to remain anonymous but his history as a problem gambler and now a gambling
                  councillor allowed for him to pull information from first hand experiences from both camps. He can provide information from the eyes of the problem gambler and from the eyes of the councillor.

                <h2 id=method_justifs> Iteration </h2>
                <p id="mindmapping_just">
                  Due to the time period that my interviews went over, which was a two and half week long period with four participants, the space and time between interviews allowed me to reflect and iterate on my interview questioning skills and
                  the questions themselves.

                  These differing rounds of interview questions was due to two main reasons </p>
                <ol> Different paths in the research emerged as I went down the primary research route. By following these paths and researching around them, better insights could emerge </ol>

                  <p id="mindmapping_just">
                    It became quickly apparent, as you'll see in the affinity diagram, that the research aim was not about the "enabling of problem gamblers" . <strong> It turned into who are these problem gamblers and were there, if any,
                      commonalities running through them.</strong> Thereby, iteration can clearly be seen, as with Interview One (with Chris Hunt) is very focused on why these gamblers start. In Interviews two - four, I tended to try and focus in
                    the following interviews about who actually are these gamblers (on a psychological level) and the definition of a problem gambler.

                    <h2> Gamblers individualistic perception of themselves </h2>
                    <p id="mindmapping_just">

                      Taken directly from the interviews, it is clear that gamblers addiction is based heavily in the psychological front, with events such as "past trauma" (Gamblers Anonymous, 2019) being able to factor into starting the addiction.
                      But in a general sense, there is this very individualistic nature to addiction. This could suggest a connection between emotion and addiction, which would link to this very personal perception that addicts have of themselves.

                      In a general sense, no gambling addict is the same, and no addict has the same introduction to gambling. Each interview gave different definitions of what a problem gambler really is, which tends to beg the question "Is there
                      truly a general definition for what makes a problem gambler?". Addicts have this personal perception of themselves that forced their addiction to occur, these are summarised into the following subheadings:
                      <br><br>
                      • Their personality created a gambling problem to be unique to them <br><br>
                      • Their internal and external demons forced them to start gambling.<br><br>

                      On a deeper level, each of these subheadings expand into more specific subtopics that analyse why these gamblers have this perception of themselves.

                      Please follow the infographic aside to assist in understanding the findings. Each finding stems from this overall heading of "Gamblers individualistic perception of themselves" and falls into two subheadings, their personality

                Each addict perceives themselves in different ways. With that, every treatment method, it forms this concept of when problem gambling becomes an issue.
                The key takeaway is that due to addiction <strong> <u> being this emotive concept, addiction can present itself in completely different ways in different people.</u> </strong>Addiction is unique to each person due to these differing
                psychological impacts (which can be found in the next subsection). <strong> A persons' internal and external triggers allows addiction, and its symptoms, to be manifested in a countless number of ways. </strong>

                For a problem gambler, the presentation of this addiction in their mind often stems from their personality. This can be due to a wealth of reasons, which again feeds into this idea that there is no concrete definition of what makes a
                problem gambler. Many often show "depressive symptoms that predate their gambling", some are "highly critical over themselves", but for others it just "comes down to that addictive personality"

                For every individual, the problem surrounding pathological gambling stems from "something" - <strong> this "something" is intricately linked to their own experiences and personality. </strong> However this "something" is unique to
                each person and, as it became clear from my interviews, <strong> <u> no professional could find the common thread that linked all these predating conditions between problem gamblers. </strong> </u> Instead generic terms were used
                like "an addictive personality" and "obsessively compulsive" to describe this atypical persona of the gambler. However, as we know from our previous research, these terms are not inclusive of all problem gambler's symptoms and reason
                for gambling

              <p id="mindmapping_just">

                For many gamblers, gambling is used as an outlet from external issues. As we know, gamblers often have issues that <strong>"predate their addiction", and through the pre-known concept of this selective recall of their winnings of
                  gambling, </strong> gamblers can simply escape their external issues. </strong>Through linking the research known about the cognitive model with these first hand experiences - this information concretes the idea that external and
                internal forces of a gambler psychologically trigger them. It triggers them to gamble to "alleviate anxiety and stress" - Hunt, 2019
                <br><br>
                This alleviation of issues forces addicts to go into the vicious cycle of problem gambling. <u> The act of gambling is a paradox; for people the act of gambling reduces stress, however the act of losing money whilst gambling
                  increases stress to try and chase the loss and make a win. </u>
                <br><br>
                This can be seen as addicts are seeking this escape from their personality and external issues, they are innately led to gambling due to their negative sense of self. <strong> But, by gambling away money, it further solidifies their
                  self-deprecating and depressive sense of self, which instinctively leads them back to gambling to escape their inner demons. </strong> In reality; problem gambling is a vicious cycle for many who are well into the addiction due to
                this desire for an escape.

              <p id="mindmapping_just">

                Not only are these individuals gambling to escape their external struggles, but the <u> high risk nature of gambling and adrenalin simply become normal for some. </u> This psychological model of the 'risk seeker' is a learnt
                behaviour (as known from the literature review) as it installs this love for the rush. Gamblers are impulsive, <strong> their "genetic and neurochemical factors" contribute to this desire for the adrenalin rush. </strong>In these
                interviews, what became clear was a gambler's <u> lack of control because of this inherent love and desire to gamble. </u> Gambler's start, in a sense, because of this infatuation with gambling- as stated by Gamblers Anonymous
                "Gambling becomes an obsession".- Gamblers Anon, 2019
                <br><br>
                The addiction metamorphizes into this infatuation with high risk behaviour because, as established beforehand, psychological triggers have brought gamblers to seek out an activity where they can escape from their demons and, with
                that, their love and desire to escape eventuates into addiction.

              <img id="flowchart_" src="img/flowchart_two.png" width=650px height=400px alt="This is an image." />
              <p id="mindmapping_just">

                For problem gamblers that are actively gambling, the concept of selective recall and overall cognitive skew enables their urge to gamble. This skew of their memory brings in this illusion of control and skew of their intuition. When
                problem gamblers are gambling, <strong> they believe that gambling is a game of "skill", and that this "skill" can be learnt. </strong> This cognitive skew alters the gambler's perception of gambling and sends the gambler down a
                rabbit hole in which they think they can outsmart the machine. This comes in the form of symptoms such as <strong> "the next win is just around the corner so I have to keep playing", "I have control over the machine, I know the
                  algorithm and my winning is coming up", "I cannot supress my urge to gamble" and "I have rituals that increase my chance of winning on the pokies". </strong>
                <br><br>
                This concept of control, or more a lack of it, for problem gamblers actively gambling, can be seen through two main concepts; the overall context of where the poker machines are located enabling <u> their cognitive skew of how much
                  money can be won through gambling, and, problem gamblers perceived control over the machine. </u>

                As we know, gamblers have this innate desire to gamble because of personal reasons, these included were: internal demons, their personality and overall sense of self. All of these reasons cultivate when they gamble at a certain
                venue. By certain insights by professionals and people who have lived through this - it is clear that the venues and the machines themselves feed into the psychology of addiction.

                This can clearly be seen even with the gambling attendant that was interviewed; she works within the poker room at a local pub. <strong> Even she is overwhelmed by the noises and often feels the urge to gamble because "You don't see
                  people losing, but you see them winning constantly". </strong> If a person who shows no symptoms of being a gambling addict can enter that room and feel an urge to gamble, it is clear that there is this psychological drive by the
                venue and the machines to enable problem gambling. Moreover, this can also be seen to be evident in my mapping sessions.<strong> It was evident the free drinks were given to gamblers to enable them to lose intuition and keep

                <br><br>
                Linking this back to the overarching heading; this contextual drive to gamble is what makes it hard for gamblers to leave this nefarious cycle of addiction. <strong> Their intuition is inherently skewed by venues and the machines,

                act exactly the same as if they have a drug or alcohol addiction"- Hunt, 2019
                <br><br>
                The biochemical urge is one clear factor that plays into the gambling addiction. As mentioned in my literature review, it is evident that the learnt behaviour theoretical model is in action here. Through positive and negative
                reinforcement of winning and losing, problem gamblers become obsessed with this idea of winning because of the trigger of dopamine. This urge leads into the idea of this lack of control; it is intricately inside these gamblers that
                they cant stop gambling. They cannot control how much they gamble. From this, it feeds into this idea of the lack of intuition and ability to control their urges to gamble.

              <p id="mindmapping_just">
                This skew of cognitive perception is clearly evident in the idea that gamblers always believe that the next win is what will make them better, and that <strong> this next win is right around the corner so by gambling a little bit
                  more they'll be ok. </strong> This illusion of control factors into the cognitive dissonance theory that we learnt in the research; <u> their skewed perception of the odds of gambling and their selective memory of winning at

                By "chasing their losses" they are inherently chasing two things; <strong> 1) to make a return on all the losses from their gambling and 2) they chase this idea of getting well, in that if they just win the jackpot, their skewed

                <br><br>
                However, linking to the main heading, this is simply not what happens; <strong> gambling inherently is a psychological addiction, with different biochemical elements that lead and form this idea of addiction. </strong> Their skewed
                cognitive perception of their control over gambling paradoxically is what keeps them gambling. This is clearly outlined in "They always think that our next bet is going to win, and the next bet will make the whole thing better/
                Tomorrow, I'm going to be a millionaire" (Law, 2019) This skew of cognitive perception is clearly evident in the idea that gamblers always believe that the next win is what will make them better, and that this next win is right

              <h3> Analysis and Key Findings</h3>

              <p id="mindmapping_just">
                What was very surprising that came out of these interviews was the influence that ritualistic behaviour and the idea that these gamblers truly believe that skill is involved in gambling. This concept feeds into the idea that
                pathological gamblers believe that <strong> they know the formula to win, they have control over the machine as it is all strategy based. </strong> By it being strategy based, they can learn and master each machine.
                <br><br>
                Once again, this idea forms the skewed perception gamblers have over addiction, they truly do not have any control over their addiction. However, their <u> illusion of control has manifested in this mathematical and strategic view
                  over gambling. </u> This false view feeds into their illusion they have of control. This is due to , as we know, gambling only being down to luck, there is no skill at all (on electronic gambling machines)
                <br><br>
                This idea is evident in the quote: "They think if they like press the button a certain way that they could change it?" - their cognitive perception is evidently skewed. Again, this feeds into their perception of control by "knowing"
                how the machines work and being able to control the outcome of them through ritualistic behaviour.
                <br><br>
                This lack of control feeds into this model of cognitive dissonance we learnt before. What feeds this illusion of control is this cognitive dissonance theory.<strong> Through selective memories these individuals have of their times
                  winning, they falsely believe that through strategy in replicating those moments, they can win again. </strong> This feeds into the illusion of control, they are saying to themselves "I know how the machine works, I can predict the
                wins and control my habit"

                  The final end of the spectrum for a problem gambler is noticeably the treatment stage, in which different medical professionals and councillors try to remove gamblers from the cycle they are in. From this stage, there were three
                  sub topics that fell under it, these included:
                  <br><br>
                  • The true reason gamblers end up gambling is to cover up repressed emotions<br><br>

                  • The treatment is a personal process of reinvention<br><br>

                  • The treatment is a journey of discovery for individuals<br><br>


                  This idea of reinvention plays true throughout these three subheadings. For a gambler, <strong> reinvention comes in the form of removing this desire to gamble and shining the light upon how they have no control over their
                    addiction. </strong> Gamblers Anonymous first steps is admitting , for the gambler, that they have an addiction and they "have no control over it". By admitting this, treatment can go down the path of removing the desire to
                  gamble due to the gambler's admittance that they do have a problem. This reinvention sheds light on the reason they started to gamble in the first place (ie: past trauma) and the shame and stigma they feel around being an addict.
                  Moreover, through reinvention their sense of self and place in the world comes to fruition once again and they realise that treatment is this ongoing process that can often take years. Finally, the recognition of their problem
                  allows for this process of reinvention. In this process, relapse can occur and often does, as if any other addiction and gamblers can truly begin to understand how they can help others with their experience of the psychology of
                  addiction.

                <p id="mindmapping_just">
                  For gamblers, there is often factor(s) that contribute to their realisation they need help. This ties into the idea that gamblers have intrinsic emotions in their psychology that supplemented them to first start gambling. These can
                  include major depressive, anxiety and other general personality disorders.
                  <br><br>
                  From this, due to their pathological gambling to hide <strong> "alleviate stress" from their poor mental illness, </strong> many of them turn to gambling and get stuck into the cycle of being stressed, gambling to alleviate stress,
                  then getting stressed from the money they’ve lost. However, due to the nature of treatment being hard to access and require a lot of self motivation to first start seeking treatment. The gambling attendant put it very well "It's
                  not like we can help you. It's very much like, Help yourself." - for a gambler to get help they have to recognise they need help.
                  <br><br>
                  This recognition they need help often comes in the form of a "relationship breakdown" Law 2019, or the fact that they "cant pay their bills" Hunt 2019, or that they’ve got a "baby on the way" Gamblers Anon 2019. Whatever the causal
                  factor is, again, <strong> the nature of them seeking addiction is very personal and it changes for different people. </strong> This feeds into the idea again that gambling addiction, and now treatment, is a very personal, emotive
                  concept. This causes a struggle for many to be able to define what is problem gambling, what are the symptoms and when do I need help? This ties into what I have been saying above with the literature review and cognitive modelling
                  - access to treatment now is based on peoples personal perception of when they have an addiction and when it becomes out of hand. Problem gambling is inherently individualistic.

                <p id="mindmapping_just">
                  Gambling, in a sense for many gamblers, is very shameful because they are often belittled by the community surrounding them. They are often viewed as this repressed being who cannot control their inhibitions and waste their lives
                  putting their kids school fees in the pokies. With this kind of stigma attached, it is no wonder why many problem gamblers often struggle admitting they have this problem in the first step. For many, <strong> that first step is the
                    worst part about getting better in treatment. </strong> This can be seen by the councillor at Gambler's Anonymous stating "People who self admit into clinic are just people hurting so much that they have got to something about
                  it". For many gamblers, their self deprecating mind forces them to belittle themselves and not seek treatment due to the stigma attached.

                <p id="mindmapping_just">
                  Treatment, for problem gambling, is naturally not an instantaneous process. Rather it is a <strong> process that is a consistent shaping and reinvention of the individual in order to reshape and align their perception of gambling.
                  </strong> This is very clearly seen with G.As work, in which one the interviewee kept reiterating when I mentioned the "winnings" of gambling; <u> I don't like to call it a win, I like to call it a return". </u> This is a clear
                  example of this reinvention of the member at GA and how his perception of gambling is realigned through ongoing rehabilitation. Moreover, a key quote from the clinician at USyd was how, for gamblers in treatment, reshaping "How
                  they report conceptualizing gambling differently" is a key aspect of the reinvention process.
                  <br><br>
                  This links into the overarching concept, as established in the literature review, that reducing gambling's harm to the individual and their surrounding family and friends is a key aspect of treatment. Through reshaping and aligning
                  their view, they can turn this emotive addiction into something these gambler's do not desire for anymore.
                  <br><br>

                  Moreover, gambling treatment houses a spectrum of people, which links again into the emotive nature of addiction and treatment. For professionals treating them, a generalised approach with group sessions and/or one on one
                  counselling is often the way. This generalised approach can be seen with GA: "I just reassure them that they're in the right place, and just for everybody what they really want to do about it". This generalised treatment comes as a
                  result of the sheer outreach that gambling addiction can have, with any race, gender, age and occupation being enabled psychologically.

                  Just like any addiction, <strong> the desire to go back and think you have control over your own inhibition is always going to be there. </strong> Through proper treatment, this hopefully never happens but it is the simple reality
                  for treating addiction. Relapse, in gambling, comes back to the previous concept of <u> "I am better now, I have this control over my addiction, I can do it just this once" </u> This illusion of control, a concept that once kept
                  them gambling, is what unfortunately brings these gamblers back to the machines and the pokies. The illusion of control factors into the key definition of what creates a problem gambler but, again, changes due to the differing
                  emotional toll it can have on different people.

                <h3> Analysis and Key Findings</h3>

                <p id="mindmapping_just">
                  Gambling addiction was only recognised in the DSM in the 1980s and there is still preconceived ideas about who these addicts are, why they are addicts and, in general, what makes someone a problem gambler. As mentioned countless
                  times in this report, there is simply so much misconception and emotional factors that can force someone to turn to gambling. Moreover, as we know, the sheer percentage of tax return the government gains from gambling makes
                  legislation and a change in the culture hard.
                  <br><br>
                  This idea for treatment professionals in the field having to adapt and create their own strategy to dealing with gambling addiction due to the <strong> lack of research in the field often forces a discrepancy in the type,
                    availability and nature of treatment methods. </strong> This falls even as back to the definition different people in treatment use to describe what makes someone a problem gambler. In fact, for all four people I interviewed,
                  each gave nearly a different definition for what made up a problem gambler. None of them were inherently wrong but they all had different heuristics that they used to judge what makes a problem gambler. This differentiating
                  acknowledge of even the most basic parts of the addiction is quite concerning; how do we expect to help individuals when everyone has their own perception of what defines and enables these gamblers in the first place?

                <h2> Affinity Diagram </h2>
                <iframe width="100%" height="360" src="https://miro.com/app/embed/o9J_kwqdCRU=/?&pres=1" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <figcaption id="iframe_cap">Hey! This iFrame has been acting weird on some computers. Just to make sure, please click the "Affinity Diagram" link in the iFrame just incase the diagram doesn't load fully.</figcaption>


                <p id="mindmapping_just">

                  Naturally, as a result of the sheer amount of data that was curated through the last research method, there is plentiful commonalities and patterns that have emerged. However, with no way to visually represent and understand this
                  large amount of data from transcripts, mapping and literature, research analysis has to occur.
                  <br><br>
                  Affinity Diagramming is the obvious next step as a result from the reasons above. It allows "analysing data (breaking down of data into parts) and synthesis of the data (forming a coherent whole out of the parts) (Tomitsch, 2018).
                  These two steps proved to be important as they would form the crux of the largest section of the report; the reframing stage.
                </p>

                <h3> The Methodology </h3>
                <p id="mindmapping_just">

                  Affinity diagramming works by putting <u> raw data and insights on the lowest level, </u> usually with a yellow post it note. After navigating through your data, you should be left with a massive wall of yellow post it notes which then can
                  be grouped into clusters. These clusters' yellow post it notes show relationships and commonalities between the clusters. (Tomitsch, 2018)
                  <br><br>

                  Following this, you name each cluster with a theme and create the next level higher on the affinity diagram with these themes. These themes are usually written in another post it note colour. Due to the sheer amount of data I had,
                  I then grouped these next level higher clusters into an even higher level theme. From this you can start seeing the common themes emerge in the data due to this grouping of commonalities. By analysing the data from these grouping
                  of ideas and themes, you can synthesize and analyse the large amounts of data given by the research process.

                </p>

                <h3> Findings </h3>
                <p id="mindmapping_just">
                  The data synthesis and analysis process by affinity diagramming caused a massive finding to be made. By taking an overview look at the data itself (and the one word headings I've added for ease of reading and at the advice of my
                  tutor), we can see there is a clear common pattern in the data. </p>
                  <br><br>
                  <h3> Problem gambling naturally being a spectrum </h3>
                  <p id="mindmapping_just">

                  The nature of the psychology of addiction is <strong> realistically a spectrum, with the causation of gambling. It depicts problem gamblers </strong> first being brought to gamble, through to their psychological experiences whilst gambling addictions, all the way to the final reinvention and treatment process. </strong> These three key aspects of what 'makes up'
                  a problem gambler formulates this idea that the concept and psychology behind addiction is that it is a spectrum.
                  <br><br>
                  This idea of the spectrum of addiction is also intrinsically linked to the lack of definition behind what makes a problem gambler. Thereby, we can link these two concepts;  <strong> <u> problem gambling and addiction is on a spectrum; thereby
                  that is why medical professions struggle to define clearly what dictates someone to have a problem with gambling.  </u> </strong>This finding was the biggest breakthrough in the research as I was beginning to realise the true nature of the
                  psychology of addiction.
                  <br><br> </p>

                  <h3> Because gambling addiction is a spectrum, there is no clear definition for a problem gambler </h3>
                  <p id="mindmapping_just">

                  The concept of what psychologically enables problem gambling is only one tiny part in the larger sphere of gambling. By synthesizing and creating this "coherent whole" of the data,<strong> we can see that problem gambling is intrinsically
                  personal, with every addict having their own experience and level of addiction. </strong> There is no direct commonalities between addicts, <strong> but our current treatment method counterintuitively generalises the treatment of problem gambling.</strong>
                  This can be seen through the generalisation of even defining these gamblers. Interviewees called problem gamblers just to have an "addictive personality", had gone through some kind of "past trauma" and "serial gamblers", when in
                  reality each have their own psychological history that had lead them to problem gambling.
                  <br><br>
                  This brings froth the idea of the spectrum, which is clearly seen in the affinity diagram and came as a direct result of the diagram. The spectrum is a start to end visualisation of gambling, the start being what made them begin
                  gambling and the end being treatment out of addiction. Gamblers are positioned on in varying degrees due to their past experiences of gambling. This is because, again, addiction is this emotive construct. Emotion is inherently
                  individualistic hence why there is a problem in defining these problem gamblers. <strong> If we cant even define what makes a problem gambler, how are we expected to even begin helping with guiding these gamblers into treatment?. </strong> This finding ties in both findings, both the spectrum analysis of gambling addiction, and the innate personal and emotive front of addiction.

                  <p id="mindmapping_just">
                    Persona's, a research methodology that enables understanding and synthesis of data, was creatively used after the lump sum of information was learnt through the interviewing and affinity diagram stages. Persona's communicate
                    "user needs" and provide a more personal visualisation of this synthesized data. This can be seen with each persona within this study being the architype for each section on the spectrum of addiction. (Tomitsch,2018)
                    <br><br>
                    In conjunction with these persona's, we also have storyboards attached to their stories. These boards dictate the "interaction between people and the service". (Tomitisch, 2018). Through the clear representations of direct data
                    (as seen by using the personas), we can act out in a space how these three levels of pathological gambler's act in a real space. These can be seen below.

                  </div>
                  <p> We have Steve, a man who is beginning his journey of problem gambling due to his breakdown between his family and himself. <strong> This concept brings into the "personality" of the problem gambler </strong>- Steve sheds light on how many
                    different external and internal factors can drive people to start gambling as an escape. This concept can be seen with the storyboard, showing Steve clearly escaping from his external troubles with his family and escaping to the
                    pub for a "casual gamble". His innate desire to escape, coupled with infatuation with the VIP room leads him down the road of a possible gambling problem </p>

                  </div>
                  <p> Next, we have Pete. Pete is atypical of this problem gambler, <strong> whose skewed perception of control links into this idea of an "illusion of constraint and control" for problem gamblers.</strong> He frequents a pub, in which he has a lucky
                    machine. His skewed perception of the chasing his losses and a lack of familial connection are all factors that have been clearly established in above research.
                  </p>

                  <p> Finally, we have Tim. Tim is the final section of the spectrum of problem gambling, in which he is in treatment for his addiction. <strong> Tim is also struggling with contextualising his addiction to his treatment professionals, in
                    which their generalisation for his addiction often frustrates him. </strong> Moreover, Tim's deep down urge to continuously gamble vocalises this idea treatment is a long winded process, it is not as instantaneous as one may deem.

                  <h2> Archaeology of the problem </h2>
                  <p id="mindmapping_just">
                    The situation illustrated at the beginning of this research was <u> the enabling of problem gambling for addicts within the context of Australian pubs and clubs. </u> As mentioned before by the divide of work, the psychology of enabling
                    addicts were my part of the brief. The problem area can be seen simply with the net profit for these venues that they gain from gambling; with Chatswood RSL gaining 28 million dollars from gambling machines alone in 2017. Simply
                    put, to forever keep gaining that margin of profit, <strong> the psychology of enabling these gamblers to keep feeding money into the pokies is a matter of life for these venues.  </strong>Through the psychological enabling of learnt theories by
                    these venues, such as the learnt behaviour model and selective cognitive recognition, these venues can gain a larger profit from gambling from these pathological gamblers. They do this through the lights, sounds and UI of these
                    machines, where they position facilities around these machines and providing 'special treatment' for serial gamblers; such as free drinks, dinner and loyalty services. By exploiting these vulnerable individuals,<strong>  the government
                    makes large cuts on tax, local pubs stay open but, in all, the problem area is that these gamblers' addiction are very much enabled by these venues and forces them to be in this vicious cycle of gambling. </strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Current systems are in place to deter problem gamblers; these include the deterrent signs in and around the VIP room with slogans such as "Think of the odds" "Your chances are one in a million". Moreover, the self exclusion
                    policy in many local pubs allow gamblers to electively ban themselves from the club. However, these solutions have a long way to go, in that, even with them implemented, problem gambling is still the worst in the world in
                    Australia, with the numbers continuously on the rise.

                                      <figcaption> Pamplets available </figcaption>
                                    </figure>


                                    <p id="mindmapping_just">
    <br><br>
                    By taking a psychological approach in order to understand and counter this problem of enabling of pathological gamblers, <strong> the approach for this study was to better understand what makes these gamblers tick, what defines problem
                    gambling, and what treatment services are like. </strong>This gives a holistic view of the psychology of gambling and gamblers which, in hand, can allow us to better understand what enables these gamblers at these venues. From this, we
                    can design a solution to create access and acknowledgement of treatment services.

                  </p>

                  <h2> Establishing the core paradox </h2>
                  <p id="mindmapping_just">
<u>
                    • Because problem gambling can affect anyone - the treatment methods need to be generalised <br><br>

                    • Because problem gambling has a host of personal emotional factors, victims need personalized treatment <br><br>
</u>

                    This is intrinsically a paradox because due to the emotional value of pathological gambling, a factor that is inherently individualistic - we currently offer only generalised solutions and treatment methods for a concept that
                    evidently very personal. By considering these paradoxes, we can later shape our reframe to consider the gambling and gambling treatment experience.
                  </p>


                  <h2> The context of the problem </h2>
                  <p id="mindmapping_just">
                    The main stakeholders that have the largest say in this problem situation would be based in three main fields; <strong> the venues where gambling is enabled, the government from the tax revenue they gain from gamblers and individuals who offer treatment for pathological gambling. </strong> These groups in tandem have attempted to solve this problem of enabling gamblers, however as established before, they have had only a little effect on the gambling addiction community. These have worked to implement currently in place measures, such as the aforementioned signs around the VIP room and the influence of local hotels implementing thee self exclusion policies.

                  </p>

                  <h2> The Field </h2>
                  <p id="mindmapping_just">
                    The field of problem gambling in Australia is large, with 200,000 individuals being affected by it every year. By expanding the context of the field to the wider society at large, <strong> we can radically begin to understand the true
                    cultural and societal factors that can contribute to the stakeholder's enabling of problem gambling. </strong> Moreover, there are two other key players in the field, the government health funding for research about gambling, and, the
                    treatment professionals. For gamblers, this concept of enabling in the venues is intrinsically based within the psychology of why they gamble.  <strong>The initial kneejerk persona treatment professionals use to define problem gamblers
                    are people with an "addictive personality"</strong> - however this generalises the treatment of gamblers as it begins to group all these addicts into one group. These currently in place systems to lump addicts into this field of
                    understanding is done as a direct response by these treatment professionals as they have the largest dictation of how Australia has a whole treats gambling addiction. They also alter the communication with the other key
                    stakeholder; the government health and research funding grants. By not truly understanding new research into what defines a problem gambler and, more from that, how our definition of problem gambling inherently enables them -
                    treatment professionals and the government are in a vicious cycle of not realising the true nature of addiction.
                    <br><br>

                    This innately creates the following statement:
                    <br><br>
<strong>
                    Because the generalisation of gambling addiction exists, treatment currently only views gambling addiction as a linear path in which all gamblers started gambling because of the same reasons.

                    In this example; it is clear that due to this enabling it opens up a larger and more pressing question. How can we begin to talk about what psychologically enables these gamblers when there is not any commonalities in the
                    heuristics we use when we talk about the personality of these gamblers?

                  </p>

                  <h2> Themes </h2>
                  <p id="mindmapping_just">
                    As mentioned in the field at play, there are main players that have say over the dictation of enabling problem gamblers within Australian Pubs. As discovered in the field, the new major player that has emerged is this<strong>  lack of
                    heuristics and definitions in defining what makes a problem gambler.</strong> This lack of definition promotes this lack of understanding in the rest of the field; such as what enables these gamblers. This concept cannot be looked past
                    upon as the real reason why the other methods in removing the enabling of problem gambling in these venues is truly because of this lack of definition.<strong> Our generalised approach to treating problem gambling; weather that be those
                    placards on the side of the machine, or the self exclusion policies - they all have not worked effectively because they are generalised. </strong>
                    <br><BR>
                    We generalise addiction in a sense that we put it down to a personality trait (as seen with the idea that gamblers just have that "addictive mindset"). In reality, when we talk about addiction and psychology, there is several
                    factors that can come into play into causing someone to fall in addiction. This is evident in the majority of problem gamblers because of the history of past psychological trauma many of them have experienced. More importantly,
                  <strong>   for many of them "symptoms of anxiety and depression predate their gambling" are a fact of life before gambling.</strong> This idea that addiction is just something that occurs is wrong. Addiction comes to fruition due to a multitude of
                    phycological events in ones life.
                    <br><BR>

                    In all, we can't begin to talk about fixing the enabling of gambling addiction when we truly do not understand the definition and cause of problem gambling to begin with.
                  </p>

                  <h2> Frames </h2>
                  <p id="mindmapping_just">
                    As established in the theme from above, that being the struggle to define what problem gambling is, a frame was created to explore and curate ideas from.
                    <br><br>
                    <u>
                    • If problem gambling can effect anyone, we must offer specific and targeted treatment methods<br><br>

                    • Because we are offering targeted and specific treatment methods, we can truly understand the personal emotional factors that made these gambler's start gambling in the first place.<br><br>
</u>

                  </p>
                  <h2> Futures </h2>
                  <p id="mindmapping_just">
                    If we continue to think along these lines, we need to be able to define what makes an addict first. One of the closest things to an adaptable service is Gambler's Anonymous service of "Screening" these problem gamblers when they
                    first come into the clinic. By doing this, they know their exact background within their family history, in terms of psychology and addiction. This is an image of the first stepping stone that could be implemented in terms of
                    personalizing treatment services. It could allow for early recognition of what made these individuals turn into problem gamblers.
                    <br><br>
                    By envisioning these personalised services, a clear definition of problem gambling could come from it. <strong> This could allow individuals to know what amount is considered to "be problematic". </strong> Moreover, by having easy access to these
                    screening services, individuals with psychological triggers for addiction in their bloodline could formulate better understandings on how they are more likely to be turned into pathological gamblers themselves. This is due to
                    many intrinsic patterns of the psychology relating to gambling can run in the genetic bloodline. <strong>This innately formulates a better outreach for at risk gamblers and to allow individuals in treatment to feel like their treatment
                    is progressively helping them due to this personalisation effect.</strong>
                  </p>

                  <h2> Transformation </h2>
                  <p id="mindmapping_just">
                    In reality, the clear long push that would be needed to redefine the entire sphere of addiction is possible, but in the short term from the basis of a university study; it isn't exactly feasible. However, what really would be the
                  <strong>   first stepping stone to revaluate the definition of problem gambling would be to get the members in the treatment agencies to adapt the newfound heuristics and models </strong> found in research. These include being able to judge the level
                    of problem an individual has with gambling by using the theoretical models of illusion of control, impairing control and having an overall selective memory in recollection of wins.
                    <br><br>
                    These theories would be easy to <u> implement to judge the level of addiction that is unique to each person because the psychologists and other clinicians already know they exist. </u>In every meeting during the interview phase; every
                    single member who had a hand in treating the psychology of addiction know that addicts exhibit behaviour that incorporate these models. <strong> The only difference was the way they use these models and behaviours to base their treatment off. Generalised treatment needs to be weeded out in place for the recognition of gambling being a very emotive concept that is personal for all. </strong>
                    By using these models, it would put these problem gamblers on this aforementioned spectrum which begins the process of understanding addiction to be unique to each and every individual due to this emotional connection.
                    between people and the way addiction shows itself. Thereby, by using this spectrum, individuals know how their treatment is truly going and how they are tracking. This also formulates a trigger for people to seek help as there is
                    a qualitative way for them to see how their gambling may be considered a problem.
                  </p>

                  <h2> Integration </h2>
                  <p id="mindmapping_just">
                    By integrating this concept of high personalisation in treatment processes and the ability to be able to know what level of problem gambler you are through a more definite and exact measurement of what really is a problem
                    gambler, it upholds a better treatment for the patient and stakeholders. <strong> The wider society of the pub can still enjoy benefits from casual gamblers without enabling the community into addiction, the government can provide a more
                    holistic and personal healthcare system that encompasses a better understanding of the true nature of addiction. </strong> Finally, the treatment agencies that give this treatment are truly going to be in the leading field of addiction
                    understanding in the world. By keeping our definition and understanding of what addiction truly is, Australia can incorporate new research and better understanding into our treatment of addiction. Moreover, by truly understanding
                    the nature of addiction, we can better engage with these venues to remove their innate enabling of problem gamblers in their venue.

    <p id ="mindmapping_just">              In conclusion, the enabling of pathological gamblers is not as simple as we once thought. Due to its nature as a complex and networked problem, there are several factors that need to be addressed in order to consider the enabling by these venues. Gambling, in a sense, bases itself off key emotional and psychological traits. <strong> What I learnt over the course of this  research task was that a simple assumption based off the research question is not usually the best route. </strong> <u> In the case of this psychological study, the research question almost became secondary to this overarching finding that "There is no clear definition for problem gambler". </u> From this, it stems into other problem, "there are not common-place heuristics to treat problem gambling".
<br><br>
                   However, by taking a step back from these complex problems - <strong>  the clear use of different 'rounds' of research methodologies, such as adapting interview questions and forever literature researching, it allowed me to form a cohesive argument in the uncovering of the true nature behind the problem of gambling in Australia. </strong> This gives way to understanding the larger sphere of gambling. Naturally, with more time this research could have delved even deeper into why there is this lack of definition behind gambling, but due to the uncovering of this insight only weeks ago by myself - there is only so much time to continuous research. However, the sheer fact of uncovering this deeper level insight can install newfound opportunities in the creation of the interface and other products for the upcoming project.
