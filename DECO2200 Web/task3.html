          <h2> Our Stakeholder Analysis </h2>
          <p> Each of our 3 reports heralded a wide variety of results. These results have heavily impacted our decision on the solutions that we could eventually design. We as a group investigated the factors which contribute to problem gambling,
            inquiring about the influence of the gambling machines themselves, the venue their held in and finally the mental characteristics.
          </p>

        <div data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="100" class=report_content_grid_text>
          <h3> Structural </h3>
          <p> In terms of structural characteristics, we found that the two most important factors for problem gamblers are 'fast reel spins' and bright flashing lights and sounds as rewarding for any amount of money 'won' as the machine's own form
            of positive reinforcement. For people to be able to gamble alone and without these factors, they need to be able to have these two aspects from the machine they play. A high jackpot being present on a machine also entices people to play
            as they think it increases their likeliness of actually winning because "It has to go off sooner or later.'' Otherwise, even non-problem gamblers can also see gambling machines as 'fun' so a potential solution can be derived from trying
            to find a new source of 'fun', as some participants stated that they gamble because it's just an easy and thrilling activity to do.

          <h3> Venue </h3>
          <p> Following an extensive legal and policy review, we found that there was very little which could actually be altered in the physical problem location. There remain “non-negotiable areas” within these spaces such as government
            regulation, which regulate the current methods of displaying warnings and signage displays as well as other regulations such as (in the same act no less) of the darkness in the room. This means that the amalgam of governmental factors
            regulating the experience of gambling correlate with the enabling of gamblers to begin the road to addiction. There is also an inherent presence of alcohol in these gambling-enabled venues which contributes to addiction rates, as alcohol
            detriments the body’s ability to perform executive functions. The findings demonstrated a need for self-regulation. Self-regulation would be the basis for many of our concepts, as there are ‘negotiable areas’ within what a gambler can
            utilise to assist themselves with self-regulation.

          <h3> Psychological </h3>
          <p> Finally, we found that there are a wide array of psychological characteristics which govern whether a person is likely to be a problem gambler. Whether or not someone is likely to be able to get addicted to something, can be mapped on
            a spectrum. Problem gambling, similarly, also able to be mapped on a spectrum as there are 3 factors which characterise an individual’s own experience with pathological gambling. These are: their experiences, addictions and treatment.
            Other than this, there is no uniform definition for what ‘problem gambling’ entails, and currently only describes that an individual spends excess time and finance doing this activity. Solutions for these sorts of issues must be able to
            remove gambling as a support beacon for people with underlying, pre-existing psychological issues</p>

              We began finding correlations between different elements within our ideation, specifically in regard to commitment and spending, the involvement of families, and trying to get the user physically away from the environment itself.
              We converged our ideation, into three core solution areas: commitment, communication and alternatives.
              We used crazy eights to collaboratively build upon these areas to iterate and benefit future solutions. Independently we selected concept areas that we had increased research knowledge on.

            </blockquote>

          </section>

          <p> The involve system was based off research into communication – specifically addiction being a force that comes as a result of one’s own personality and internal/external factors. For example, imagine yourself as a gambler who gambles
            to hide personal thoughts - It’s only natural for people to rely on their friends and family to help them with something so personal
            <br><br>
            Gambling and addiction are intrinsically private. Problem Gamblers unknowingly distort the truth when they communicate their addiction - there is shame surrounding it. Everyone has a secret, though, you are only hurting yourself by
            lying. Problem gamblers need to communicate more freely and openly in order to seek help. If we can communicate without judgement, then treatment services can be quickly and easily accessed. This communication can lead to treatment. A
            combination of reduced shame, easy accessibility and honesty leads to increased likelihood of a problematic individual seeking treatment.

          </p>

          <h2> What is it? </h2>
          <p> The involve system starts better, honest and easier communication between gambler and family. The machine recognises this and changes the UI for the gambler; and displays percentages of losses alongside testimonials given by the
            family.

            Primary for the involve system is users that want to start a conversation between gamblers and their loved ones to get them into treatment.
            <br><br>
            The process begins before the pub. They get a notification from the involve portal – and the UI on the EGM changes. The UI shows testimonials on the screen and the amount lost. Feedback is sent to family in relation to where they are,
            how long the user has been there. This is based on the research that gamblers often gamble to hide their inner demons and repress feelings. When the problematic individual leaves the pub, the family get notified when they left, and are
            able to see the exact time and money spent. This keeps the conversation open, when they get home there is statistical evidence of their problem.
          </p>

          <h2> Why we didn’t follow through with this concept: </h2>
          <p>
            The reason that the involve system wasn’t selected as a chosen space, was due to the lack of viability in the sense of governmental regulation industry regulation and the infringement of civil liberties, in other words: it breaches on
            our unnegotiable areas. If the device were to alter its UI, all pubs would need to implement this, or specific pubs would be disadvantaged. Likewise, the lack of complete understanding into when this problem can be identified causes
            conflict; the user may not believe they have a problem, but the family might, if the family restricts the user due to this. This can be seen as an act against the civil liberties of the user and cause an area for manipulation. However,
            the concept of increased family communication was carried through into the final solution space. Increased visibility of problematic behaviour to the family, likewise, a direct chain of communication was updated into the final
            solution.

            <h2> But what is the Comm-it?</h2>
            <p>
              The primary use case for the ‘com-it’ is for problematic individuals who want assistance regulating excessive spending. “Australian lose more money from gambling than any developed nation in the world.” (Sebag-Montefiore, 2017)
              Research has shown gamblers “continue to persist, even after suffering extreme financial loss” (Jazaeri, 2012). To counteract this problem gambler Riana sets pre commitment levels, but as soon as she gets on the machine she breaks,
              because she becomes emerged – a concept called restoration. Likewise, venues incentivise excessive spending by ensuring the users remain in their chair, comfortable. Thus, three problems are correlating. how can we implement
              restoration in a committal card and reduce comfort?
              <br><br>
              The com-it ideated on the problem but settled on the idea that took inspiration from the previous research report, specifically the interview with Jackie.
            </p>



            <h2 id = ogflow> The Original User Journey </h2>
            <p> Two devices are at play: the problematic gambler uses the ‘com-it wearable’. The solution specifically relies on a wearable, as the concept is ‘a watch for income’, having a device so easily accessible increases visibility. The
              families: use the phone application. After they both activate their accounts, the problematic individual has to ask the family to transfer money onto his com-it, increasing the challenge of gambling and allowing for an open and
              collaborative discussion.
              <br><br>
              Once the money is transferred, it visually displays as a bar educating the user on income lost, rather than income gained. <span id="strong_li"> “Bar graphs are the easiest form of graph to understand, and most effective at mapping

                <h4> The Technology </h4>
                <p> Finally, we found that there are a wide array of psychological characteristics which govern whether a person is likely to be a problem gambler. Whether or not someone is likely to be able to get addicted to something, can be
                  mapped on a spectrum. Problem gambling, similarly, also able to be mapped on a spectrum as there are 3 factors which characterise an individual’s own experience with pathological gambling. These are: their experiences, addictions
                  and treatment. Other than this, there is no uniform definition for what ‘problem gambling’ entails, and currently only describes that an individual spends excess time and finance doing this activity. Solutions for these sorts of
                  issues must be able to remove gambling as a support beacon for people with underlying, pre-existing psychological issues</p>

                <h4> Non negotiable areas</h4>
                <p> The com-it doesn’t break any current industry or governmental regulation. The product itself can be implemented independently, without harming the stakeholders.

                  <h4> Criteria</h4>
                  <p> In theory the com-it meet our criteria as it allows the user to identify that they excessively spend. It allows the user to be educated and re-evaluate their problematic behaviour. It informs the user about their lack of
                    control but forfeiting control and allowing collaboration. Finally, it subsequently deters gambling due to increased challenge to partake in the activity itself, the benefit of which is reduced financial stress.

            <h2> The Problem </h2>
            <p> A precondition is that: users have to want help - or they will manipulate others to achieve their goals. Multiple use cases were explored, determining multiple alternative flows where manipulation could be invoked from the
              problematic individual.From the use case exploration it was clear the manipulation of the system was going to be a great concern for the outcome of the ‘Com-it’. Likewise, uptake of the Com-it, is likely to be relatively low due
              to the lack of user control and freedom.

            <br><br>
            Our testing implemented methods to gain qualiative and quanititave primary data, while the explorative stage allowed us to explore the feedback based off secondary solutions. This allows us to iterate based of research, rather then
            opinion. Exploration of our product iteration will categorising them into the innovation diagram: desirability ( “a desirable solution, one that your users need” (Orton, 2017)), feasibility (“building on your current operational
            capabilities” (Orton, 2017)) and viability (“a sustainable business model” (Orton, 2017)) If we meet all three areas, we have sustained the “ideal innovation process” (Orton, 2017).

          <h1 class=method_header> Employing our Methodologies </h1>


          <h2 id = usability> Usability mix test: Think aloud/roleplay </h2>

          <div class=general_box_content>
            <p>
              <span id=strong_li> Aim: </span> The aim of mixed usability testing was to test our conceptual model against our user’s mental model, to understand if our design principle implementation was successful and where the core errors were.
              We implemented role-play to understand the usability in conjunction with conceptual application and think aloud to find out why the users are having issues.
            </p>
          </div>


          <h2> Methods: </h2>

          <br><br>
          <p><span id=strong_li> Usability test: </span> We begin by explaining what the concept is, though at no point do we explain to the user how to complete the task, as by doing so we would minimise the success of the testing. We ensured our
            abstract tasks broadened incrementally from low level tasks to high-level tasks. We ensured all aspects of the application and wearable were tested. A template was filled out based on completion, error, success, user satisfaction,
            general comments and solutions to their errors/unsatisfaction (template can be found in the appendix). <br><br>
            <span id=strong_li> Think-aloud:</span> The method allowed us to not only figure out where the errors were, by why. Throughout the iterations, think aloud’s provided key data in our problem of ‘clarity’, and allowed us to determine
            whether or not it was navigation clarity or the lack of conceptual information. However due to this method, the use of ‘reaction time’ in iteration two became unreliable.<br><br>
            <span id=strong_li>Roleplaying </span> was a method used to test the concept. As only the gambler could use the wearable, we couldn’t have one user test both devices. Therefore, one facilitator acted out what the corresponding persona
            would be doing. Our aim was to be provided with greater quality of data, specifically in relation to themes, as we could receive emotional reactions rather than formal evaluative responses. This is evident in the first iteration, as
            roleplaying revealed the conceptual flaw of our design – enabling aggression.<br><br>
          </p>



          <h2> Sample and recruitment </h2>
          <p> Six users were tested all three iterations. As research has shown that “The best results come from testing no more than 5 users” (Nielsen, 2000). All participants are either gamblers, or family members, ensuring the testing is viable
            to our target audience.

          <h2> Adapted Co Creation </h2>
          <p> Co-creation was adapted to suit our strategy. Rather than applying the original method, of sitting the user down and letting them design, we believed it would be more efficient to implement a co-creation element though out all
            aspects of the testing including ‘how would you solve it’ questions in the tasks that had errors (usability testing) and the criteria that had errors (survey). Users who provided larger solutions (e.g Nicola with the self-regulation
            feature), where tested twice, upholding the ‘comparative’ nature of this method. By only implementing this method with a small group, we ensured that the data was reliable, as new users wouldn’t have a large investment in the product
            as co-creation participants would. This allowed the user to be involved not only in the interface, but in the conceptual development. Upholding a human centred approach, whilst also being time and resource efficient.

            experience within the field, and weren’t direct peers, therefore risk was minimal. Heuristics were beneficial within our iteration, as this is the only method where our participants weren’t gamblers, therefore were able to analysis our
            product from an interface perspective rather than a conceptual perspective.

          <br><br>


          <span id=question_iteration> How can we reduce alcohol related violence? </span> <br><br>
          Solution:
          The Com-it was further developed to implement Alt-funs concept of relaxation – breaking the negative feedback loop through relaxation techniques of mindfulness. This was updated through a new breathing feature. It uses vibration to
          assist with breathing techniques. The function ‘pops-up’ if the wearable determines heart rate is too high (built in Apple Watch function), and the vibration increases suggesting breathing in, decreasing to suggest breathing out. <br><br>

          <span id=question_iteration> How can we make it more accessible for individuals who have been drinking?</span><br><br>
          Solution:
          The com-it removed many of the wearable functions, reducing it to bare minimum so users can use it while under the influence of alcohol. This applies the, 80/20 rule and flexibility usability trade off. <br><br>

          <span id=question_iteration> How can you reduce the commitment level over time? </span><br><br>

          Solution:
          There is a new overall limit, where users can reduce cash out limit and payment limit over time. This was an implementation suggested by our tutor. <br><br>

          <span id=question_iteration> How can you ensure users won’t break? </span><br><br>
          Solution:
          Through providing external regulation. The Com-it implemented multiple factors of the involve system, including increased communication with the loved one through a new messaging function, the viewing of past activity, time and date of
          gambling. All of which allow the family to be more involved, and provide them with more monitoring abilities that will assist the users to “not break”. <br><br>

        <h3> Wireflow </h3>


<h3> Inspiration </h3>
<p> Inspiration was taken from CommBank to ensure functional consistency with transactional input and output. The aim of which was to make it more intuitive to the user. (Logo, 2018). This further (in theory) adhered to the gulf of equation as we created “visual similarities” (Whitenton, 2018) between all of the com-it devices, and products that have similar system status designs such as Tesla. We likewise created “functional similarities” between all of the com-it devices, (Whitenton, 2018), and products that have similar systems such as CommBank.

          <h3> The Application </h3>
          <p> The application has 4 core functions ‘messages’, ‘transfer’, ‘activity’ and ‘limits’. We wanted to ensure a linear UI navigation for set up in both the wearable and application, while providing a circular navigation for the core
            product functionality, using the ‘homepage’ as the “primary navigation” (Chambers, n.d.) in both devices.

          <h3> The Wearable </h3>
          <p> The wearable features 3 core functions ‘testimonials’, ‘cash out’ and ‘activity’. Notifications within the wearable specifically act as “Responsive navigation” (Chambers, n.d.), as the wearable constantly reacts to the applications
            actions, most of its navigation is subsequently triggered by the application. <br><br> Our goal was to create internal consistency within the application and the wearable, ensuring navigation can be transferable and concise.
            Therefore, the navigation is very similar, but the functionality is different.

            <h3> Pagination </h3>
            <p> The ‘com-its’ interface goal was to “keep the interface simple” this was done by “avoiding unnecessary elements” ("User Interface Design Basics", 2019). The play of white space was suggested to improve focus, reiterating that
              “simplicity is a powerful alley” ("User Interface Design Basics", 2019). The use of dividing information allows the content to be spread out and “allows the user to go through the order of the content more efficiently” (Affairs,
              n.d.). Providing a “step by step information flow” based off page layout and page design. (Ivanova, n.d.).

        Weight was added to the visual display, as applying weight and text on call to action elements “increases visual clarity” ("Design Principles: Hierarchy of Information", 2013).

            <h3> Progress bar </h3>
            <p> The design features a bar graph, showing the amount of income left in the ‘Com-it’. The visual design on the application was inspired by Tesla, we wanted to ensure the visibility of system status of the wearable is clear and
              displayed is a minimalist aesthetic way. The progress bar “makes sure the system communicates what is happening” ("User Interface Design Basics", 2019), including the” action” of taking money, out and the “change in state” of the money
              left ("User Interface Design Basics", 2019). The constant feedback loop of the bar allows users to constantly be monitoring the progression of their limit.

            <p> The home page features a menu of actions in which can take place, these menus are vaguely based of the design of Hamburger menus – horizonal lines in which provide hierarchical information, this was to ensure a “clean” and
              “recognisable” design (Tran, 2019).

            <p>
              Buttons remain internally consistent. This creates allows the “consistency in layouts and design to facilitate efficiency” ("User Interface Design Basics", 2019). Allowing the user to feel “comfortable” as there is a “pattern in the
              language” ("User Interface Design Basics", 2019).

            <h3> Text fields </h3>
            <p> The text fields “replicate common UI elements within other products” ("User Interface Design Basics", 2019). The application only allows a single line of text to be sent to the wearable, due to the screen size of the Apple Watch
              being too small for longer messages.

        <h2> Visual design </h2>

        <p> As a group we diverged our UI visual design, though we emphasised this part less as we wanted the visual design to be based of user feedback, rather then our own aesthetic option. We used design principles to be the basic of the design,
          allowing the form to follow the function. We used inspiration from similar products (CommBank and Tesla) and the original storyboard of the com-it, then ideated the designs.
        </p>



        <br><br>
        <p> The final design implemented our design principles, however, to ensure more efficient usability and content discovery, we altered the header, and rearranged the elements based off the engagement diagram.

        </p>


        <h3> What we couldn’t develop this round: </h3>
        <p> <span id=strong_li> Colour and texture: </span> – Due to the prototype being low fidelity, colour and texture of the UI was not experimented with. In the future, colour has the ability to “draw and redirect attention” ("User Interface
          Design Basics", 2019) to important UI elements, specifically using contrast.
        </p>

        <p> <span id=strong_li> Typography </span> – Typography was not implemented due to the prototype being on paper. In the future typography can be used to create “hierarchy and increase readability” ("User Interface Design Basics", 2019).
        </p>

        <p> <span id=strong_li> Errors prevention </span> – This first test was important for the user to ‘break’ the system, we wanted to determine if our cognitive model was different to the user’s mental model, thus we will use testing to
          determine areas of the application in which there are increased errors and prevent them in future iterations.
        </p>

        <p> <span id=strong_li> Icons </span> – Icons are an important informational component, in which due to the lower fidelity we did not implement. Icons can be used to remove the amount of written data and create visual clarity.

            button to many times. <br><br> Task 1: Users didn’t understand the terminology of “platforms” – Nicola and Lily. However, they did like the implementation of signing in with social media as it “is such a big part of life now” – Jack.
            <br><br>
            Task 3: Users stated they “Didn’t know how much money they were transferring on- should be able to see clearer on how much money they are transferring.” – Lilly. <br><br> Task 4: Users stated “it was confusing specifically putting data
            and time before activity” – Nicola. <br><br> Task 6: Users were confused about the terminology and the concept: “I didn’t realise it was in that icon” – Jack. “I’m confused about the terminology” – Lilly. “Can you adjust what’s the point
            if I can’t adjust?” – Lilly. <br><br> Likewise, task 7: Users didn’t like the terminology “reword the lock” – Nicola. All of which highlights, the key cause of error being clarity, specifically terminology.

          <h4> The Visualisation: </h4>
          <p>Users stated they liked the visualisation “Presentation is good, how much they spent and the money you’ve given them” – Jack. </p>
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
          <h4> Consistency: </h4>
          <p> Users believed there was good consistency. Users implemented transferable knowledge in sections such as ‘transfer’ from “CommBank” (Tim) and “After pay” ( Jack) </p>
        </div>

        <h3> What was done bad. </h3>
        <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
          <h4> User satisfaction was lowered due to negative emotional response. </h4>
          <p>Users conducted roleplays while usability testing was occurring. The process saw a split of emotional reactions within the beginning, middle and end. In the beginning users stated that the fact they have to get their family to assist is
            “sad” – Tim. During users stated the messages are “depressing” – Clarissa. Users stated the tracking of money loss makes them “anxious” – Jack. Even users who weren’t gamblers, but family stated: “I love the idea of monitoring – but id
            hate it used on me” – Nicola. And the end, Users stated when the limit was up: “this could cause domestic violence, I can imagine someone going home to bash the other person on this application” – Tim. Tim followed up from his statement
            by saying: “there needs to be more fun” – Tim
          </p>
        </DIV>
        <div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>
          <h4> Research found that domestic violence increases after “sporting games: </h4>
          <p>Specifically it can occur if betting and “loosing money” is involved (TRUONG, 2018). Due to the family being the one in control of this money, there was a high risk of violence against that person. Moreover, due to gambling being in the
            context of the bar, alcohol related, violence could occur. This created a large problem area.
            <br><br>
            It was critical to re-evaluate the concept, because releasing a product with this is amount of risk was dangerous. Through research into reducing anger within UX, we turned back to our use case: if our target is individuals who want
            assistance; we had conceptually missed a key point of this design: the loss.
          </p>
        </DIV>

        <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
          <h4> Stages of grief: Change management:
          </h4>
          <p>Because there was loss, it’s a change management problem. We understood the user would be using this product if they want help, but we didn’t anticipate the correlation between the factors that lead to that, and where they are
            emotionally when they use our product. The addict is suffering loss, a loss from an activity that they view as fun.
            <br><br> <span id=strong_li> Denial – </span> We can assume individuals will be past this stage when they use our product. However, the user may be in denial about how negative their problem actually is. Denial can be assisted by “hope”,
            specially hope for the future (Bethel Funerals, 2019).
            <br><br>
            <span id=strong_li> Anger -</span> Anger was the most important element missed. And can be assisted by finding “new strengths” and creating “new patterns” (Bethel Funerals, 2019).
            <br><br>
            <span id=strong_li> Bargaining – </span>Bargaining was an element we anticipated specifically manipulation. Implementation of locks reduced the likely hood of bargaining.
            <br><br>
            <span id=strong_li> Depression – </span>The increased amount of negative reinforcement within the product has a high likely hood of creating a depressive state, due to the lack of support for the loss.
            <br><br>
            <span id=strong_li> Guilt –</span> Users mentioned guilt in regard to messaging the family and in the survey in regard to reduced stress. Users stated the messaging would increase guilt, to “be less selfish” – Tim.
            <br><br>

            It is clear that the increased negative reinforcement and lack of positive emotional support has led to the user reacting negatively, due to the product concepts being congregated in stage two of the change curve (Ross, n.d.) specifically
            the concepts of the product support the anger and depression, rather than assist to bring them out of it.

          <h4> Users didn’t like not having Control: </h4>
          <p>Users didn’t like the lack of control. The heuristic of user control and freedom was low, as the com-it took away the user’s control. Our Users and tutor provided solutions specifically allowing the user to identify themselves when they
            need more help. Though it creates a paradox, how can we give the users control, if they can’t control, due to them thinking they have control?

        <h3> Impletemented Feedback </h3>
        <br><br>
        <h3> Emotion </h3>
        <p>
          <span id=question_iteration> How can we decrease the anger, numbness and sadness while using this application? </span> <br><br>

          Goals were implemented, allowing the application to target the ‘anger’ through providing the users with ‘new strengths” (Bethel Funerals, 2019) Goals allow the user to retrain their learnt behaviour. Streaks will be implemented, as they
          provide a form of “gamification” ("What Are Streaks and Why do They Work?", 2019), allowing us to implement Tim’s feedback from round one as he stated “there needs to be more fun” – Tim. Streaks are “habit forming”, they provide a sense of
          “motivation” ("Benefits of Goal Setting", n.d.) which is critical as goals are implemented in the new ‘self-regulation’ section, were the user remains in control and must learn to motivate themselves ("Benefits of Goal Setting", n.d.).
          Motivation was likewise a suggestion for our users (Nicola). Goals provide the user with “clear direction” alongside a way to “track progress”. ("Benefits of Goal Setting", n.d.).
          <br><br>
          If the user completes a goal, they get congratulatory messages, allowing us to counteract the “numbness” and “Sadness” with “affirmation” and “positive reinforcement” (Bethel Funerals, 2019). It provides a “pat on the back” for the users
          (Morin, 2019). Messages have pre suggested options, as it was a core suggestion from Lily and Nicola, likewise reduces the risk of users sending shocking messages to get the gambler home “I’d use it to shock the user e.g. I’m leaving you” –
          Nicola.
          <br><br>
          All of which works on operant conditioning. If we apply positive reinforcement to users completing goals “it makes it more likely that the behaviour will occur again in the future” (Cherry, 2019). We provide the users with “social
          reinforcers” through the use of congratulatory pop up notifications (Cherry, 2019).

        <h3> Control </h3>

        <p>
          <span id=question_iteration> How can we assist regulation, while providing increased control?</span> <br><br>

          Implementing Benji and Nicola’s feedback and added a self regulation function. As discussed previously to supplement the lack of control, goals will be introduced to apply personal motivation. Through research we found a correlation between
          control and trust, “Control is good, but trust is better” (Jensen, 2014), due to the users having no control there was no trust with the families “Total control means zero trust” (Jensen, 2014). Limiting was removed, as users didn’t like
          how only families could do it.

        <h3> Trust </h3>

        <p>
          <span id=question_iteration> How can we gain more ‘trust’ with the user? </span> <br><br>
          Implementing the user solution of ‘terms and conditions”. </p>

        <h3> Education </h3>

        <p>
          <span id=question_iteration> How can we implement more educational components into the product? </span> <br><br>

          Added fun fact at the beginning of the application, as “education helps to bring productive results” (Reddy, n.d.)


        </p>



        <h3> Personalisation </h3>

        <p>
          <span id=question_iteration>How can the product provide more of a personalised experience? </span> <br><br>

          Implemented names, and personalised goals. This was important as “74% of customers feel frustrated when content isn’t personalised” (Burgess, n.d.)

            <h3> The New Use Case </h3>
            <p> Due to the added function, there is a new use case. The primary precondition still remains users have to want help, but in the new use case – users want to help themselves. Even though the conceptual development has provided with more
              emotional support, the user can still ‘break the system’. The new use case suggests that users who don’t have families to be able to use this product, a concept that the original ‘Alt-fun’ was able to do well. The following diagram
              explores most alternative flows where this can occur. </p>

            <h3> Improved design principles:</h3>
            <div class=general_box_content>
              <p> <span id=strong_li> Conditioning </span> –We replaced negative ‘conditioning’ with positive, with the aim that users would have a reduced emotional response. This idea was suggested by the users.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class=general_box_content>
              <p> <span id=strong_li> Forgiveness </span> –We took out limits as It caused the most confusion and put the 24-hour lock at the end of the mock-up to decrease confusion. More notifications are provided to the user, keeping them aware of
                their transaction, and allowing them to stop the transaction at any time. </p>
            </div>
            <div class=general_box_content>
              <p> <span id=strong_li> Hierarchy</span>Hierarchy was improved, the pages of the devices are laid out more ‘neatly’, improving the white space, and enhancing the visual layout. Hierarchy was implemented in putting cash out in activity,
                this is referred to as ‘invisibility’. It forces the user to have to explore their transactions in order to get more money out.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class=general_box_content>
              <p> <span id=strong_li> Constraints </span> – The amount a user can take out on the com-it is under a constraint, and the messages have the option of pre-established messages which are constrained. This was a preference by our users.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class=general_box_content>
              <p> <span id=strong_li> Aesthetic usability effect: </span> The second mock-up was done on Sketch instead of hand drawn as we believed the ‘messiness’ lead to some of the confusing specifically task 4 (display of the limit bar). </p>
            </div>
            <div class=general_box_content>
              <p> <span id=strong_li> Design by committee: </span>A lot of the solutions provided by the users were implemented – including more clarity, messages, emotional response, more control, goals, limits, and the 24-hour lock.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class=general_box_content>
              <p> <span id=strong_li> Flexibility usability trade off: </span>– The new development has increased flexibility: this round will be important in testing whether or not the current concept is too convoluted, subsequently affecting the
                usability of the UI.

        <h3> New ones we are testing: </h3>


        <div class=general_box_content>
          <p> <span id=strong_li> Chunking</span>We increased the chunking of information, specifically within the new goals page, allowing information to be easier to process. The aim of this was to increase the visual clarity of our users. </p>
        </div>
        <div class=general_box_content>
          <p> <span id=strong_li> Confirmation </span>Confirmation was added for notifications as on the previous test some users ‘ignored’ the notifications. Users now have to respond to the notification, confirming that they have seen it, or at
            least are aware of it. This is particularly important for streaks. Confirmation is likewise added in transfer, the device now provides more notification pop ups, warning the users about their transaction and gives them the option to go
            back.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class=general_box_content>
          <p> <span id=strong_li> Halo effect: </span> In theory: if designs look better it increases user satisfaction as they will believe the performance is better. In previous tests decreased user satisfaction occurred mostly when there was
            increased errors. These errors were mostly due to the lack of clarity of information, which was believed to be due to the ‘messiness’ of the prototype. We designed iteration two on a wireframe mock-up. This allows us to test whether or
            not a more minimalist and neater design would increase usability.
        </div>
        <div class=general_box_content>
          <p> <span id=strong_li>
              Factor of safety </span>Due to the increased aggression, the factor of safety was discussed. It was believed the aggression occurred from an increase of negative reinforcement, as no part of the original application actually
            congratulated the user or made them feel happy. Goals were implemented, likewise more control was given to the user. If further anger is discovered through testing, new measures of safety would have to be discussed. </p>
        </div>
        <div class=general_box_content>
          <p> <span id=strong_li> Flexibility/usability trade-off </span> – the com-it remains functionally consistent with common banking apps, likewise being internally consistent. Both allowing users to transfer knowledge and learn the
            application quicker. </p>
        </div>
        <div class=general_box_content>
          <p><span id=strong_li>Performance vs preferences </span> – the com-it remains functionally consistent with common banking apps, likewise being internally consistent. Both allowing users to transfer knowledge and learn the

            <h3> The application: </h3>
            <p> The set up for the new iteration is slightly more complex, users still have to connect to Bluetooth, but they have a shared account, that has two log ins – family regulation and self-regulation. Users who choose family are subjected
              to the same navigation as iteration one. Whereas individuals who choose self are provided with the same functions as the family regulation but replaces messages with goals.

            <p> The navigation for the wearable remains the same. Family regulation opens up ‘testimonials’ , alike the first iteration, but the self-regulation replaces testimonials with ‘goals’. The new development the wearable focuses more on

          <h3> The interconnection navigation: </h3>

          <p> The first round of testing provided unviable testing of the interconnect between both the application and the wearable. There is a perceivable risk of the interconnection, as users continuously have to go back and forth within the
            products, specifically within set up, and now within the whole mode of self-regulation. This interconnection navigation will be tested this round, by updating the usability templates to feature the test for self-regulation, having tasks
            that require the user to use both the application and wearable at the same time. </p>

          <p> The implementation of icons “helps the users navigate the system” (Affairs, A, nd). Especially visual leaners, and individuals who don’t want to read, and “ignore” informational components. A key issue with the last round was users
            unable to find settings, as the icon was unfamiliar. All icons will be externally consistent with iconography of other applications, in other words, we won’t be creating new icons from scratch. </p>

            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <p> Typography was applied for this round. This was not only due to the team wanting increase visual clarity, by digitalising the paper prototype, but due to the poor handwriting within the first iteration, reaction time couldn’t be
              appropriately tested as the readability became subjective. Typography increases “scan ability, legibility and readability”. (‘User Interface Design Basics’., 2019). The choice of font was still undecided, however we implemented
              Montserrat, as a base font.

          <p class=para_report> <span id=strong_li>While over all the success of the tasks were high, a large compliant was the co-navigation and the length it took to go “back and forth” between devices. </span> In a real-world application, users
            wouldn’t have to experience that, therefore, while that input is valid, that problem area is an effect of the testing, rather than the product itself. From all the reaction time data, it was clear that testing the ‘time’, wasn’t a
            reliable criteria for our tests to iterate off. While the first iteration lacked reliability due to the subjective nature of reading handwriting, iteration two caused more concern for subjectivity as there are patterns in participants
            rather then tasks.

                In comparison to iteration one, the criteria of ‘stress minimisation’ as become worse. </span> More users believe the product increases stress, even with added conceptual features, such as positive conditioning, goal setting and
                self-regulation. This is due to users being stressed about “not getting money out” (Ryan), “lack of control” (Kyle) and users simply stating, “it won’t reduce it, but it wont increase it” (Adam). Users also mentioned the
                implementation of ‘mindfulness’ should in theory reduce this stress. However, the criteria of ‘reduces stress’ may be obsolete, as users who wish to gain help will likely be in a stressful situation, rewording the criteria to – not
                increasing stress may be more beneficial.

        <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
          <h4> Control: </h4>
          <p> Even with increased control functions, the criteria has not changed. “I really like that you have the option, makes me feel like I have more control” – Adam, “, makes me feel like its collaborative, rather than I’m being submissive” –
            Monika. The criteria of control is subjective to which option the user picks, and within the testing the users liked the control, however within the survey there was mixed results, therefore it began to question the necessity of this
            criteria.
        </DIV>
        <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
          <h4> Education: </h4>
          <p>Even though the criteria of education has preformed poorly this iteration, the implementations of fun facts were positive, “A little fact breaks it up and makes sense as it makes you stop and think” – Emily. Users wanted more
            “personalised education”(Emily) even with the implementation of goals and educational reminders based off goals. The confusion of what the difference is between ‘education’ and ‘identification’ meant that ‘education’ became an unnecessary
            element, if the education we provide fits more within ‘identification’.
        </div>
        </DIV>
        <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
          <h4> Stress/goals: </h4>
          <p> Our negative emotional response reduces, however our stress criteria increased. This was due to the added personal pressure of goals. “it’s a good reminder but it would make you feel guilty, and you get a message as the level goes down
            – reminding you of your fails”– Emily. “I would get more emotional and upset about streaks, losing them and breaking them” – Joel. “If I break a streak I wouldn’t care as much to limit myself (sense of giving up) – Benji. However, even
            though the goals increased stress, it decreased the negative emotional reactions (specifically anger and sadness) while using this product, therefore a trade-off must occur.

          <p> Alike the first iteration users liked the functional consistency of our application, “It is like something I’ve seen before” – Ryan , “That was actually fun to use” - “I like how you made it like Netflix” – Adam. Users stated it was
            consistent to products such as Breathe, snapchat, opal, CommBank, Messenger, Netflix.

          <h4> The visualisation: </h4>
          <p> Alike the first-round users liked the visualisation of the limit, “Personally I like to see the progression of money, with the stops and conscious knowledge – Kyle,” It’s real good to see these stats, for me it’d help me rethink” – Adam

          <h4> Streamlined process
          </h4>
          <p> While some navigational clarity is still needing to be improved, specifically the use of invisibility, users liked the process and navigation of the product. “It’s streamlined, or straight to the point – I know how to do it– mon, “I
            feel like it’s pretty self-explanatory, - Ryan., “Quick and Efficient” – Kyle. </p>

        <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
          <h4> Co-navigation </h4>
          <p> Co navigation was a concept wanting to be explored throughout this iteration: <br><br>
            Users over all stated it was “good” – Adam, and “made sense” Emily, this is evident in the high completion and success rates. However, uses stated it was “Lengthy” - Kyle “took a tad longer than expected – it slows me down” – Adam.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
          <h4> Learnability
          </h4>
          <p>Users mentioned that their lack of clarity was in correlation with learnability “if I learnt the application id get used to it” – Adam. “You have to get familiar with the app first” – Emily.
            “If I had time to actually play with it, id would be fine” – Mon. “You get used to it eventually” – Adam. The fact that users are specifically stating their lack of clarity will improve alongside the learning of the application, is
            positive as it not only means they are willing to learn, but they believe this learning will occur naturally.

        <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
          <h4> Suggested messages
          </h4>
          <p> Users preferred the implementation of suggested methods, mostly due to efficiency, “I will see the suggest messages because I don’t feel like typing” – Kyle. Users still like the concept of messages, however this testing provided more
            positive associations (rather then sorrow) to the function, “Having a way to see that many people care is something that helps me” – Adam

          <h4>Navigational clarity</h4>
          <p>Users weren’t sure were cash out was, After a purposeful attempt to increase the challenges (after the first iteration) to get to cash out, through manipulating the hierarchy and implementing ‘invisibility’, it negatively affected the
            usability as users couldn’t find it, even when they searched through the application. “I wasn’t sure If the home screen had the cash out” – Emily, “I didn’t know where it was – I did have to search around a lot” – Monika, “It was
            difficult to find” – Emily. While forcing the users to read through their transactions to get cash out, may in theory work, in practise the payoff was increased error.

        <div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>

          <h4> Information clarity:: </h4>

          <h4> Setup </h4>
          <p>“What does family and self-do?- needs more clarity in streaks and Bluetooth – what does ServiceNSW do?” – Benji. Users stated set up needed to have “instructions” – Mon. <br><br>

            Benji suggested to improve the set-up, especially by providing a “progress bar” and implementing the “iPhone” set up process with the use of a “code” . He suggested to “Make it more fun – make it nice to set up. Congratulate them'.'
            However, Benji did like the lock out feature of the product “if I didn’t have something to lock me I wouldn’t I like it”.
            <br><br>
            Usability testing likewise found similar results “Make Bluetooth clear that it’s only part of the local setup” Make an account yourself not on google “ – Ryan. “Bluetooth connection and setting up could’ve been a little clearer, initially
            with the scan” – Kyle.

        <div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>
          <h4> Transfer: </h4>
          <p>“How would I know where I’m transferring money too?” – Adam. Users lack of trust lead to passive aggressive comments, specifically in transfer as it involved the collection and distribution of money. “It was fine – a bit more information
            provided would be nice since its my money”. </p>

            provided would be nice since its my money”.
            <br><br>
            Suggestions for increasing clarity: Individuals suggested more “information screens” – Kyle. Wanting more “details of this activity – more in-depth breakdowns” – Ryan. More “notifications just before they break their goals” – Ryan.
            Suggestions: Most users suggested to make it animated “flashing and stuff – make things more prominent” – Emily. “Make certain features flash when it’s read to use them, or let the application tell me what is important” – Noel.

          <p>“I don’t want to see my bank card” “too many notifications – specifically goals”. – Benji, “Maybe have less words” - Kyle. “Too much writing” – Monika. “Is it necessary to have another confirm on my wearable if I’ve already done it on
            the phone”– Ryan. Users subsequently stated the increased information was “tedious” - Ryan
            <br><br>
            Users stated they weren’t reading the information: “I’m not sure if I read most of that” – Adam, “There was a lot of info that it was easy to go through without reading” – noel. One user in particular contradicted herself, stating “I
            doubt I would use the application to tell me this- I would skip this” – Monika, even though she asked for more information previously.
            <br><br>
            Therefore: users need more clarity, and they provided solutions to fix that through increased information, notifications and pages, however, they don’t want more information, notifications, and the information we already provide they
            don’t read.

          <h4> Aesthetic Design</h4>
          <p> The heuristic of Aesthetic and minimalist design was reduced. Benji stated the “Infographic is too complicated” and the “goals set up has no atheistic consideration”. Benji and Monika offered solutions – specifically “more icons” and
            “putting the self and family choice together with the infographic”, our usability testing likewise found the same data “alternatively you could put all the descriptions on this page if it’s easier” – Ryan.
            <br><br>
            Our criteria of consistency within heuristics declined, specifically aesthetic consistency. “Data representation and consistency with goal setting and goal display – improve the experience”.
            <br><br>
            Users were also confused about the lack of colour, “Is there any reason why its black and white”. – Ryan

        <div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>
          <h4> Minor edits</h4>
          <p> Users over all rated this iteration high, and due to such they began questioning the spelling, the sizing, floating – minor UI elements. “The select button doesn’t highlight when you hover over” – Ryan ““Make text box a lil better”
            –Emily. “Is there a way to make the buttons and words look more flashy, like. Oh there they are?” - Kyle, “Nah it’s good, font could be small” – Adam.

        <div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>
          <h4>Reaction time</h4>
          <p> The timing for completed tasks preformed poorly, this could be due to the implementation of thinkalouds in the tasks, the context of the test, the skill level with the mock-up and based on how much the user liked to pause and discuss.
            The results found correlations between reaction time, between people, rather then tasks. Therefore, the data reduces in its viability </p>

            Users liked the concept: “I think that’s good, if I had no way to get money then obviously it’d stop me”- adam. Users understood it might make them angery, but they are “grateful”
            “In those cases I know I get real angry sometimes, and an app like this will definitely at least attempt to help people like me which I’m grateful for” – Adam, a user stated this was due to the choice of ‘family’ “if its set by the
            device, they would get less angry because if the gambler gets really pissed and be like – transfer me more now” – Monika. Users had more positive associations to this function – " it gives the person time to do other things, and actually
            think about their behaviour” – Monika.

            use of vibration may increase heart rate “Sceptical as vibration could raise heart rate” - Kyle

          <span id=strong_li>Has our product decreased the anger, numbness and sadness while using this application?</span>
          <p>Yes, anger has decreased specifically with the lock and the limit display, users acknowledge that may get angry however the users followed up with positive reactions to the function by saying that it Is ‘needed’ e.g. lock. However, while
            the anger and emotional responses have decreased our criteria of stress has increased subsequently from the implementation of goals – due to increased pressure. </p>

        <div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>
          <span id=strong_li> Have we assisted regulation, while providing increased control? </span>
          <p> Slightly, users like the increased control (specifically stated within the usability testing), however our criteria of ‘control’ has remained the same.

        </div>

        <div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>
          <span id=strong_li> Have we gained more ‘trust’ with the user? </span>
          <p> Slightly, users want less visibility of system status, and increased information in relation to transfer, but trust of collaboration has decreased.

        <div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>
          <span id=strong_li>Have we implemented more educational components into the product? </span>
          <p> Users liked the education components we added, yet rated the education lower within the criteria, specifically stated there needs to me more “personalised education” even though that was the core implementation of goals, streaks and the
            fun facts. </p>
        </div>

        <div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>

        <div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>
          <span id=strong_li>Have we provided the user with the information they need?</span>
          <p> No, the users feedback of ‘lack of clarity’ has remained, however, users need more information, but want less. Users stated they didn’t like too much words and notifications, but they also asked for more notifications and information.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>
          <span id=strong_li>Have we improved the input elements to make it more usable? </span>
          <p> Yes, input elements were discussed the least, other than increased confirmation for transactions and the ability to save account details. Our design overall accomplished an 100% completion rate with few errors, a large contributor was
            ease and consistency of ‘input’. </p>

        <h2> Summary </h2>
        <p>
          Desirability drastically improved from iteration one, no conceptual changes were needed. Feasibility was discussed more, specifically the key problem of ‘clarity’, not only continuing from iteration 1, but now becoming a paradox. Viability
          is improving, alterations to criteria may need to be implemented. </p>

        <h2> The Development </h2>
        <h3> Implemented Feedback </h3>
        <br><br>
        <p>
          <span id=question_iteration> How can the criteria of stress be positively affected without removing the source of stress (goals)? </span> <br>
          <span id=strong_li> Solution: The design freeze of mindfulness </span> <br>
          Mindfulness was a concept implemented at the start of the iteration process, but properly tested in iteration two. The usability testing users stated that in theory it would decrease anger, but the execution might increase it. Specifically,
          the use of vibration. Due to our mock-ups unable to implement the element of vibration, the problem cannot be reliability tested. However, other sensory mechanisms were discussed. The use of visual flashy and sound would be unviable, and
          the context of the gambling room would distract. Therefore, only touch and smell are left. Smell isn’t technologically feasible yet, and touch is already implemented with the vibration. Therefore, the team decided to implement a ‘design
          freeze’ into the mindfulness problem.
        </p>



        <p>
          <span id=question_iteration> How can education and control change? <br>
          </span>

          After previous development on education and control, based on prior feedback, the criteria did not improve, and in the case of education; got worse. The concept of “notifying the users on their lack of control” became unnecessary, as users
          have increased control in ‘self-regulation’, therefore the criteria is subjective to the mode they pick. It is also important to discuss, we are testing with gamblers, individuals who state they as ‘casual’, they don’t believe they have a
          problem. This may affect their perception on the concept of control, as they don’t want to stop gambling, thus don’t want reduced control. In relation to education, users stated they needed more “personalised education” which was the
          concept behind the previous implementations. After discussion into the criteria of education, the team decided that ‘identification of problematic behaviour’ was very similar to education. Therefore, the criteria of education were also
          removed.
        </p>



        <span id=question_iteration> How can the criteria of stress be positively affected without removing the source of stress (goals)? </span>


        <p>

          A large conceptual change occurred in iteration 2 after high amounts of negative reactions to the product. The implementation of goals, self-regulation, and positive conditioning reduced the anger and sadness. However, all of which has
          increased stress. Goals and streaks made the user stressed due to the added pressure of not wanting to ‘break them’. Previously the pressure came from the product, now the pressures are coming from within the user. This is both negative and
          positive. Negative as users stress will decrease desirability, but positive as users are able to more effectively self-regulate without the need for external control. Therefore, as a team we collective decided that a trade-off must occur.
          Which is worse domestic violence or a user feeling pressured to stick to a limit they set themselves? While we are still investing in the problem area of ‘emotion’, the criteria of ‘reducing stress’ has become obsolete.
        </p>


        <h3>The Concept </h3>


        <p>

          Iteration 2 provided no conceptual changes to our design, not only due to user’s desirability for the product dramatically increasing, overall criteria increased. The concept (story board and user journey) are the exact same as iteration 2.
          This allowed us to implement a design freeze. It positively affected the development as it was strategic. Rather than implementing more conceptual upgrades, we could build on the base product we already have and implement the previous
          problem errors in the future.
        </p>


        <h2> Function: Usability </h2>
        <h3> Usability feedback </h3>

        <div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>
          <p>The main usability feedback, like Iteration 1 was the lack of clarity within the design. The overall design doesn’t have any major alterations in comparison to Iteration 2:

          </p>
        </div>


        <span id=question_iteration>How will the removal of invisible functions effect navigational performance? </span> <br>


        <p>
          Navigational clarity was poor due to the play of ‘invisibility’ for ‘cash out’. We removed the invisibility of cash out and make it its own function. Users also suggested to make it more animated and “flashy”, which we did with colour.
          <br><br>

        </p>


        <span id=question_iteration> How can we improve the input clarity of transfers? </span> <br>


        <p>
          Input clarity was poor within ‘transfer’. Users wanted more visibility of system status specifically ‘who and what’ they are transferring too. We improved this by providing more confirmation through the use of notifications, and a step by
          step process for transfers. <br><br>


        </p>



        <span id=question_iteration> How can we increase the informational clarity? </span> <br>


        <p>
          As previously stated, we increased notification, in the form of confirmation and warnings. This was especially implemented within ‘transfer accept’ and ‘cash out’.
          <br><br>
          Users didn’t like the use of ‘service nsw’ and ‘google’ sign in, therefore we removed this feature.
          <br><br>
          Users needed more explanation of streaks. More information was provided to the user in the set-up process of the application.
          <br><br>
          The set-up process has progress notifications - a suggestion from our heuristics.
          <br><br>
          We implemented Benji’s solution of code pairing, both devices now show the same ‘code’ so that the watch knows its pairing to the right device.
          <br><br>
          Activity page (suggestion) now has more historical data on past transactions. Likewise, goals (another suggestion) has more personalised timeline goals – daily, weekly and monthly. Allowing our concept to support over the short term and the
          long term. <br><br>


        </p>

        <span id=question_iteration>How can we increase information clarity but also decrease it? </span> <br>


        <p>
          As previously discussed, there was a paradox of users needing more but wanting less information.
          <br><br>
          There was a double confirmation issue for the self-regulation process – where users would have to confirm on the application, then confirm on the wearable. This was removed from the wearable, now confirmation (on the self-regulation
          process) is only for transfers.
          <br><br>
          Visibility of system status was too high in some tasks – from heuristics it was stated that the user didn’t want to see their banking details. We implemented a new account details section, which goes through the transfer in steps, hiding
          previous data.
          <br><br>
          Individuals stated the device was “too wordy”, Infographic and choice of mode are now on the same page. As we established users NEED more information, but WANT less, we implemented question marks, if the users press it, they get the
          information, if they don’t, they can continue. Thereby, making it the user’s choice.
          <br><br>

        </p>

        <span id=question_iteration>Is reaction time a viable matrix? </span> <br>


        <p>
          Users could complete tasks, but not all users completed tasks within the same speed ratio. There was no patterning to suggest certain tasks performed worse than others, rather the patterning was indicating that specific users had problems.
          Therefore, the team decided no viable data can be sourced from reaction times and therefore will be removed from testing.
          <br><br>
        </p>


        <span id=question_iteration> How will the implementation of minor edits positively effected our design? </span> <br>


        <p>
          Minor edits – users wanted colour on hover, text boxes bigger, works and buttons to look flashy, and font to be larger. <br><br>

        </p>

        <span id=question_iteration> How will increased aesthetic considerations affect the design? </span> <br>


        <p>
          The main element that performed poorly in aesthetic was the goals section. Benji suggested the use of different graphs to decrease cognitive load – pie graphs were implemented, as they can breakdown larger datasets effectively, likewise
          implementing Benji’s solution of having semicircular sliders for the Goals. <br><br>

              <h3> Improved design principles:</h3>
              <p> <span id=strong_li> Consistency </span> –Our users like the functional consistency, however in the last iteration users didn’t like the aesthetic consistency. A style guide has been implemented this round to ensure this is met. </p>
            </div>
            <div class=general_box_content>
              <p> <span id=strong_li> Confirmation </span> – Due to inattentional blindness (discussed later), confirmation is increasing. This ensures users don’t ‘ignore’ information and subsequently prevents error due to increased clarity.
              </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Added principles:</h3>
            <div class=general_box_content>
              <p> <span id=strong_li> Inattentional blindness </span> – This refers to the lack of awareness. Users stated didn’t read information that was provided. Are the users confused because they need more information, or because we aren’t
                helping them read the information? We did this by increasing confirmation and using colour to draw attention. </p>
            </div>
            <div class=general_box_content>
              <p> <span id=strong_li> Highlighting </span> – This was suggested by the users and implemented to draw their attention to the areas of reduced ‘clarity’ e.g. call to action buttons and key information. In order for highlighting to work
                – the product cannot have “more than 10% of its UI highlighted or the effect decreases” (Lidwell, Butler & Holden, 2003). </p>
            </div>
            <div class=general_box_content>
              <p> <span id=strong_li> 5 hat rack</span> Our previous test suggested users liked our current navigational process, but in order to implement new features of ‘more detail’ for goals and activity, the hierarchy must be altered.
                Implementing the 5-hat rack is effective as it works of ‘logical connections’ (Lidwell, Butler & Holden, 2003). We structured all content by ‘categories’ and backed up those categories by colour. The added function of more detailed
                activity will remain in the category of ‘activity’. Furthermore, ‘activity’ on the wearable will categories its data by the goals (time and money) rather than just a broad transaction history.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class=general_box_content>
              <p> <span id=strong_li> Colour </span> After two iterations, colour was finally implemented Colour has the ability to ‘attract attention, group elements and increase aesthetics’(Lidwell, Butler & Holden, 2003), everything we needed to
                improve on within this iteration. </p>
            </div>

            <div class=general_box_content>
              <p> <span id=strong_li> Number of colour </span> “No more than 5 colours of It becomes complex”(Lidwell, Butler & Holden, 2003). Our style guide explores these colours below. </p>
            </div>

            <div class=general_box_content>
              <p> <span id=strong_li> Saturation </span> Call to action buttons implement saturation. These are seen as ‘friendly”(Lidwell, Butler & Holden, 2003), while the lack of saturation of the background and foreground is seen as
                ‘formal’(Lidwell, Butler & Holden, 2003). Users can associate colour with not only with task and function, but in theory, perceive those elements as inviting. </p>

            it to be more “intuitive” (Gagan). Success was over all good, task 4 had a success error due to users unable to go ‘back’ on the mock-up. Overall satisfaction can be improved, like the family regulation, user’s satisfaction diminished due
            to ‘size of font’, ‘overuse of the gradient’ and ‘mock up not letting me go back’.

            to think much about it” (David). Users stated they were able to “reuse their skills” (Adrian), but alike all tests the most comment element mentioned was font and colour “break up the constant use of the gradient” (David)

          <p class=para_report> <span id=strong_li> Users satisfaction was mostly in relation to style and mock-up navigation.</span> Users stated the “alignment and font is too small” (Megan). Users however liked the “question marks” (Nicola), and
            the “two circle style of the goals” (Nicola). Users didn’t like looking at the data from the goals page “because I had to learn something” (Lilly). Users likewise stated the transfer ‘step by step is annoying’ (Adrian).

            Success was low specifcally on task 3, as users wanted to skip the monitoring of the heart rate. “The only thing to be wary of is if people want to opt out of this function” (Gagan). Users stated they liked the implementation of sliders
            and detailed goals. “Seems very interactive and detailed like you got the daily monthly and weekly stuff”.

            <h3> Visibility of system status reduced by 3.7 (4 too 0.3) </h3>
            <p> This was due to the implementation of more notifications for transfer, allowing users to know who they are transferring too,
              and provide more confirmation of what you are transferring. Users stated they wanted more “animation” (Lachlan and Tanmay) but over all users couldn’t viably test the system status as the “app never actually froze (Tahlia and Mia).

              Match between system and real world maintained a 0
            </h3>
            <p> Users stated the “system mimicked how an actual apple watch and iPhone would work” (Lachlan) and stated there was functional consistency with “pairing and cash out” (Tahlia).
              A common theme across all iterations was consistency, users stated it was “like things I’ve used before” (Tanmay).

            </h3>
            <p> Consistency and standards dramatically improved. Users stated the “screens look very similar” (Tahlia), and it “looked like a real iPhone and iWatch app to me” (Lachlan) Users stated the “colours were a bit rough – but the shapes and
              positions of text and buttons were consistent” (Lewis). Both Mia and Sean mentioned that the product was almost “too consistent”, that the gradient became “Annoying”.

            <h3>Error prevention increased by 0.3 (1 too 1.3)</h3>
            <p> User errors remained unvital but had increased from the previous test. Users stated they couldn’t test errors correctly as “not all the buttons worked” and it subsequently made tasks easier as it was a forced “linear” product (Tanmay)

            <p>
              Control improved due to increased confirmation of transfers. “I think having the undo and redo us good particularly in the cash out process” (Tahlia). Lewis gave this heuristic the lowest mark, he mentioned that control was minor due to
              “The 24-hour lock, but I guess that’s the point”. The majority of users stated that the freedom was minor, but they understood “that is the whole concept” (Sean)<br><br>

            <h3> Aesthetic and minimalist design decreased by 0.2 (3 too 2.8) </h3>
            <p> The aesthetic and minimalist design decreased in severity due to fixing the goals page, however, still remains a problem area. Users within this round were cautious about font and sizing, likewise the effect of which on a black screen
              and the overuse of the gradient. “I don’t like the gradient, just a personal preference” (Thalia) “The wearable is very small” (Lachlan). “Font is really small though, especially on the dark screen” (Tanmay)

            <h3>Recognition rather than recall decreased by 3.7 (4 too 0.3)</h3>
            <p> Decreased by 3.7 users understood the application better with the implementation of colouring, specifically colours highlighting the important elements. “the gradient did that well – highlighting important buttons” (Lachlan). Users
              stated the buttons had very good clarity “it was pretty easy to tell which was a button and what was text.” (Tahlia).

            <h3>Help users recovering from error decreased by 0.7 (3 too 2.3)
            </h3>
            <p>There were two core reasons for a high recovery rating: mock-up error and font. Users stated they couldn’t recover due to the mock-up having inactive buttons. “The navigation elements were there but they couldn’t be used” (Lewis).
              Users stated that the size of text would cause errors. “I didn’t struggle using the app. But I think some people could. Especially the older people with the reading.” (Lachlan).

          <div class=general_box_content>
            <h3> Help and documentation decreased by 2.5 (3 too 0.5)</h3>
            <p> Help and documentation decreased due to the increased amount of information provided. Most users stated they didn’t need help therefore documentation wasn’t needed “Never need to use it”(Lachlan). Users mentioned the iterations
              development of the help icon “I did see the little ? things which was effective.” (Tanmay).

Users stated this was because of “goals” (Nicola). “Limiting and awareness of your spending” (David). “Informs about the nature of their addiction – goals and awareness” (Megan). The device “visualises the problem and allows people to seek help” (Gagan) and “communication with the family – and streaks” (Lily).

                    “I think it does that by the goals - You can see how you are behaving during the week as re-evaluate based of that.

                  <span> – Adrian </span>
                </blockquote>
              </div>


              <p class=caption> Throughout all iterations all users were consistent with their believe that the com-it allows users to re-evaluate their problematic behaviour. Users stated this was due to “goals, especially the detailed ones on the phone” (Adrian). “Constant awareness of the problematic spending” (David), “the display of losses and their family sending the messages – allows them to escape their own mind” (Megan).

                <span> – Gagan </span>
              </blockquote>
            </div>


            <p class=caption> Personalisation hasn’t been impacted this iteration. Users stated it was personalised due to “the use of names and goals” (David), the fact it is a “mix of messenger, CommBank and Fitbit – which is all personalised” (Adrian). Nicola who tested the first round stated, “it’s a big improvement”. However, Gagan stated “no addiction can be fixed with just an app – it had to lead to treatment its not a replacement for it”. While as a team we understand this, the com-it’s aim isn’t to “Fix” gambling, rather, to mitigate the harms from the addiction.

            <span> – Gagan </span>
          </blockquote>
        </div>


        <p class=caption> Across all iterations, even with the problem’s of usability found in testing, users overall believe the product is easy to use. It “Holds your hand” (Nicola), “Functionality felt the same across, just some design fixes but nothing that detracts from its use” (Megan). Users stated the consistency with other applications created more ease “functionally is just like other apps, I know where to click” (Gagan).

          <span> – Megan </span>
        </blockquote>
      </div>


      <p class=caption>
Viability decreased. A common theme was – not being able to “stick to it” (David and Adrian), it would only work “if you want help”( Lilly) and “It would work for a small percentage,'' however, “it will be effective for that percentage” “You didn’t design a one size fits all solution” (Gagan). this means our users believe we have targeted the solution based on quality rather than quantity.

            </div>


            <p class=caption> All users across the last two iterations believed it allows them to identify problematic behaviour. Users stated, “It allows you to identify just like how it allows you to re-evaluate” (Adrian). Through “goals and if you exceed them” (Nicola). Megan stated they would have already identified the problem before using this application, but it will help with “regulating the problem”.

                <h2> Viability </h2>
                <h3> Done well: </h3>
                <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>

                  <p> Our criteria: Deterrence, Identification, ease and revaluation performed well this round as previously discussed.   </p>
                </div>

                <h3> What was done bad. </h3>
                <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
                  <h4> Harm got worse: </h4>
                  <p> A core concept that appeared through testing, is the fact users believe this is a ‘last resort’. Users believed it doesn’t reduce harm as much as phycological treatment can. This isn’t necessarily seen by our team as a negative, as the com-it doesn’t stop the gambling, its aim is to mitigate negative behaviour. The team aren’t phycologist and cannot create a product that stops gambling as that would require breaches into our non-negotiable areas. As long as the com-it reduces the harm of gambling, it is seen by our team as effective.
 </p>
                </DIV>
                <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
                  <h4> Viability got worse. </h4>
                  <p> As a team we understood from the beginning that a major drawback is the fact we are creating a product that users may need, but they don’t want. “I’d say out of 100 people, 30 would actually use it – but it would really work for that 30%”. As previously discussed, this isn’t necessarily a negative, we knew we couldn’t solve the larger problem due to the non-negotiable areas, and we couldn’t solve every individual’s problematic factors. Therefore, we will continue to target that market segment, but it provides a protentional horizon; to branch the product out into a broader demographic. </p>
</div>




                  <h2> Desirability </h2>

                  <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
                    <h4> Our goals: </h4>
                    <p> Users liked the goals: “I really like the implementation of the daily weekly and monthly, it reminds me more of the Fitbit. (Nicola)  </p>
                  </div>

                  <h3> What was done bad. </h3>
                  <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
                    <h4> Emotion </h4>
                    <p> Emotional reactions have slightly improved as users are following up negative emotions with positive rationale. “I broke my streak - you just feel a bit empty. But it’s a good way to [tell them] how well they are going” (Lily), “you tried good job - but it doesn’t physically punish you” (GAGAN).

                    <h4>Mindfulness </h4>
                    <p> Mindfulness has been put under a design freeze. Users stated, alike the last round, in theory its beneficial, but it could be detrimental. “Coming from a medical background, mindfulness is one of the most all-encompassing activity that can help more people” (Gagan). “This works for me, but id be wary of violence of throwing the commit far away – just make it’s not a forceful vibration” (Megan)
 </p> </div>




 <h2> Feasibility </h2>
 <h3> Done well: </h3>
 <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
   <h4> The setup code: </h4>
   <p> From the previous iteration, the team implemented the user suggestion of providing a set up code. Users stated “I like the code thing – I don’t know how Bluetooth works but it makes it seem easy” (Adrian).
 </p>
 </div>

 <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
   <h4> The graph: </h4>
   <p> Across all iterations users constantly mentioned the limiting graph as the most effective element in the product: “I really like the pie chart design; I haven’t seen that on a phone app I know of. That works really nice” (Megan),“I can look at it quickly and know how much left I have” (Gagan)
 </div>

 <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
   <h4> Highlighting </h4>
   <p> After both iterations had large problems in ‘clarity’ the team implemented the design principle of ‘highlighting’. “The colour is good at directing me” (Nicola) “Again, bright colours work well - I can see all information really quickly” (Megan)
 </p>
 </div>


 <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
   <h4> Question marks </h4>
   <p> After the previous implementation, more information was provided by using ‘?’ icons, that way users could get the information they need, when they want it. “I like the question marks, I didn’t notice them before but I like that” – Nicola.
 </p>
 </div>

 <h3> What was done bad. </h3>
 <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
   <h4> Mock up had navigational errors: </h4>
   <p> The majority of the errors derived from mock-up errors, specifically buttons not working. “I can’t go back - there’s no next button for Bluetooth” (Adrian) This indicated that the team needed to ensure every button in the mock-up worked, because users want to explore.

</p>
 </DIV>
 <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
   <h4>Correlation between visual design and errors </h4>
   <p> There was a pattern within heuristics of ‘aesthetic and minimalist design’ correlating with ‘recovering from error’. Users mentioned the ‘font being too small’ (Tanmay, Mia, Lewis), which directly effected error “I didn’t struggle using the app. But I think some people could. Especially the older people with the reading.” (Lachlan).
</p>
</div>


<div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
  <h4>Users had increased clarity due to confirmation notifications, but users got more annoyed. </h4>
  <p> Clarity improved with notifications, so did user’s awareness: “Really makes you aware of how much you are getting out, I like it because usually I don’t care but it’s kind of forcing me to care” (David). However, users believed It was annoying: “It would piss me off – but I like how you can save it” (Nicola).
</p>
</div>


<h2> Minor Style Changes </h2>
<div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=general_box_content>
  <h4> Users constantly mentioned the visual design, subsequently they provided a list of minor changes to the application </h4>
  <p> <span id = strong_li> Lines </span> <br>

    “I don’t know what that line is, have line above ‘or’ or bellow” (NICOLA)<br><br>




    <span id = strong_li> Terminology </span> <br>

    “What does scan mean? - Why do you phrase it in that long paragraph; couldn’t you just say; “A gambler’s family member”. Like I had to read all that just to figure out it said family. (Megan)<br><br>



      <span id = strong_li> Opacity </span> <br>

      “Oh, I didn’t realise that was even a button. Its so faded why is that?” (Gagan). “Its too grey right now like it just blends into the watch. The watch needs more” (Lily) <br><br>


      <span id = strong_li> Font </span> <br>

      “Fonts a little hard to read”. (Nicola). <br>
      “Maybe have variety in the font”  - Nicola. <br><br>



      <span id = strong_li> Iconography </span> <br>

      “The picture in the circle is a little to hard to read though” (David), <br>
      “Too small I think, maybe make it bold or something? (David).
      <br><br>

      <span id = strong_li> Too much consistency with buttons </span> <br>

      Those buttons look too similar. (Gagan),
      <br><br>


      <span id = strong_li> Colour </span> <br>

      Also the gradient was too overused again when I sent it. Please no more gradient (Lily), “That colour for the lock is so bright too” (Gagan)
      <br><br>



      <span id = strong_li> Notifications </span> <br>

“The design of that notification doesn’t match the rest of the app; I think it’s the shadowing?”(Megan)      <br><br>



<span id = strong_li> Alignment </span> <br>

“AGAIN the alignment is too small” (Megan)
      <br><br>



<span id = strong_li> Messiness </span> <br>

“The incoming transfer is messy” (Nicola.)
     <br><br>

  </p>
</div>



<h2> Objectives: </h2>
<br><br>


<h3> Feedback objectives: </h3>
<br><br>

<div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>
  <span id=strong_li>How has the changes to our criteria affected our design?</span>
  <p> Overall it hasn’t affected our design too much, users still mention the theme of education and stress but within the testing activities and other criteria. </p>
</div>

<div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>
  <span id=strong_li> Has the removal of invisible functions effected our navigation? </span>
  <p> Yes. We had a 100% completion this round which is significantly better than last round. All users were able to get cash out on the wearable, and over all users believed the product is “simple”.
 </p>
</div>

<div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>
  <span id=strong_li> Has input clarity of transfers improved? </span>
  <p> Yes. Users stated the use of ‘highlighting’ has improved clarity, both navigation and input. The implemented notifications have increased awareness, yet, they believe it’s too ‘annoying’.
</p>
</div>

<div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>
  <span id=strong_li>Has the implementation of more information, but less visible information increased clarity?</span>
  <p> Yes, users had significantly less questions in relation to conceptual and usability clarity. The users liked the implementation of the Bluetooth set up code and the implementation of the ‘?’.
 </p>
</div>

<div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>
  <span id=strong_li>Has our aesthetic improved?</span>
  <p>Yes and no. Our consistency has improved, but users gave feedback into visual design elements within every single task. Users stated there was too much consistency and there needed to be variation in font, colour and in some screens; iconography.
 </p>
</div>

<div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>
  <span id=strong_li>Have the minor edits effected the product?</span>
  <p>Yes, the minor edits, including the use of colour have dramatically affected our design. Due to highlighting user’s navigation is easier, however users also mentioned more minor edits this round like variation in colour and font, fonts needing to be larger, buttons needing to have a balance of ‘faded’ and ‘saturation’ and alignment needs to be fixed.</p>
</div>

<h3> Core objectives: </h3>

<div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>

</div>

  <div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>

  <span id=strong_li>What was done poorly? </span>
  <p>Harm and viability criteria. Mock-up errors, visual design and errors, annoying notifications, how it would ‘naturally work’, Minor style changes. </p>

        <h3> Implemented Feedback </h3>
        <br><br>
        <p>
          <span id=question_iteration> How can we improve mock-up errors?</span> <br>
    <p>      Ensuring all action buttons on the mock-up work. The team went over it constantly attempting to press every button, and eventually all mock-up errors were resolved.

        </p>

        <span id=question_iteration>Visual design and errors and minor style changes:</span> <br>
  <p>      Improve the style guide: implement more variety in font and increase its size. Increase the variety of colour and ensure the gradient will only be used on call to action buttons. Fixed the alignment, replaced unreadable icons on the wearable with colour coordination and reduce ‘messiness’ of incoming transfer by altering opacity and increasing white space.

      </p>


      <span id=question_iteration>Annoying notifications:</span> <br>
<p>      Users believed the notifications were annoying, however, like the previous iteration, these notifications provided the clarity that was lacking. ‘Annoyance’ and ‘stress’ are two concepts added to future horizons.

    </p>


    <span id=question_iteration>How to increase viability:</span> <br>
<p>   Our viability is further explored within future horizons, however the feedback from the last round, like previously discussed, wasn’t necessarily bad.

<h1> Final Solution </h1>
<p> The original com-it was a wearable pre-commitment card, that told the users to stop, when they used all their money. Following weeks of iteration, numerous development sprints, user testing and exploration. the commit has evolved. Once a product that put up barriers on excessive spending. Now: a device that encourages the user to set their own barriers and deter themselves.
 <br><br>
The com-its aim was never to solve the gambling problem in Australia, but to help the users problem with gambling. As a team, we believe we have succeeded in our aim. The com-it encourages family communication, and provides self help methods, for gamblers who want help. It gives a physical visual on income lost, rather than income gained. It gives the user goals and aspirations, to assist their change management process. The com-it continuously encourages the user through their time of loss.
 <br><br>
The development of this product has not only has ensured improved usability and user satisfaction, but has made us continuously more aware of our users’ internal conflict. Allowing the com-it to develop alongside the user.
 <br><br>
Therefore, the com-it was once just to commit to reduced spending, now it's committing to your limit, your family, but more importantly – yourself.
 <br><br>

<h2> Future Horizions: </h2>
<div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>

<p> Future development would include: <br><br>
- Reimplementing the criteria we left out: stress, education and control. <br><br>
- Testing the mindfulness function with an actual programmed device.<br><br>
- Reducing the amount of annoyance in the notifications.<br><br>
- Visceral emotional design (getting users to want to use this product) ("What is Emotional Design?", n.d.)<br><br>
</p>
</div>
  <h2> Viability: </h2>
  <div data-aos="fade-right" class=general_box_content>
<p> Our viability throughout the report has been based of our criteria, but in reality, it would be based on a business model.<img class=report_photo id=conditioning_info src="img/business.png" height=500px> </div> </p>
