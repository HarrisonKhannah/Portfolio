    <h2> Our Stakeholder Analysis </h2>
    <p> Each of our 3 reports heralded a wide variety of results. These results have heavily impacted our decision on the solutions that we could eventually design. We as a group investigated the factors which contribute to problem gambling, inquiring about the influence of the gambling machines themselves, the venue their held in and finally the mental characteristics.
    </p>

<div data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="100" class = report_content_grid_text> <h3> Structural </h3>
<p> In terms of structural characteristics, we found that the two most important factors for problem gamblers are 'fast reel spins' and bright flashing lights and sounds as rewarding for any amount of money 'won' as the machine's own form of positive reinforcement. For people to be able to gamble alone and without these factors, they need to be able to have these two aspects from the machine they play. A high jackpot being present on a machine also entices people to play as they think it increases their likeliness of actually winning because "It has to go off sooner or later.'' Otherwise, even non-problem gamblers can also see gambling machines as 'fun' so a potential solution can be derived from trying to find a new source of 'fun', as some participants stated that they gamble because it's just an easy and thrilling activity to do.
</p>
</div>
</section>

<section class = report_content_grid>
<div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class = report_content_grid_text> <h3> Venue </h3>
<p> Following an extensive legal and policy review, we found that there was very little which could actually be altered in the physical problem location. There remain “non-negotiable areas” within these spaces such as government regulation, which regulate the current methods of displaying warnings and signage displays as well as other regulations such as (in the same act no less) of the darkness in the room. This means that the amalgam of governmental factors regulating the experience of gambling correlate with the enabling of gamblers to begin the road to addiction. There is also an inherent presence of alcohol in these gambling-enabled venues which contributes to addiction rates, as alcohol detriments the body’s ability to perform executive functions. The findings demonstrated a need for self-regulation. Self-regulation would be the basis for many of our concepts, as there are ‘negotiable areas’ within what a gambler can utilise to assist themselves with self-regulation.

<div data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="100"  class = report_content_grid_text> <h3> Psychological </h3>
<p> Finally, we found that there are a wide array of psychological characteristics which govern whether a person is likely to be a problem gambler. Whether or not someone is likely to be able to get addicted to something, can be mapped on a spectrum. Problem gambling, similarly, also able to be mapped on a spectrum as there are 3 factors which characterise an individual’s own experience with pathological gambling. These are: their experiences, addictions and treatment. Other than this, there is no uniform definition for what ‘problem gambling’ entails, and currently only describes that an individual spends excess time and finance doing this activity. Solutions for these sorts of issues must be able to remove gambling as a support beacon for people with underlying, pre-existing psychological issues</p>

      <p class = overaching_para> With the criteria in mind we used forced association to diverge our ideation. We gathered the themes explored within our criteria and began rapidly ideating, allowing us to focus on core solution areas, and setting aside findings that created unviable solution spaces e.g. law.
We began finding correlations between different elements within our ideation, specifically in regard to commitment and spending, the involvement of families, and trying to get the user physically away from the environment itself.
We converged our ideation, into three core solution areas: commitment, communication and alternatives.
We used crazy eights to collaboratively build upon these areas to iterate and benefit future solutions. Independently we selected concept areas that we had increased research knowledge on.

Individuals wanted to be rewarded, addicted individuals need motivation to maintain on the path of recovery, and rewards incentivise doing an activity.

          </section>

          <p> The involve system was based off research into communication – specifically addiction being a force that comes as a result of one’s own personality and internal/external factors. For example, imagine yourself as a gambler who gambles to hide personal thoughts - It’s only natural for people to rely on their friends and family to help them with something so personal
<br><br>
Gambling and addiction are intrinsically private. Problem Gamblers unknowingly distort the truth when they communicate their addiction - there is shame surrounding it.  Everyone has a secret, though, you are only hurting yourself by lying. Problem gamblers need to communicate more freely and openly in order to seek help.  If we can communicate without judgement, then treatment services can be quickly and easily accessed. This communication can lead to treatment.  A combination of reduced shame, easy accessibility and honesty leads to increased likelihood of a problematic individual seeking treatment.

  </p>

  <h2> What is it? </h2>
            <p> The involve system starts better, honest and easier communication between gambler and family.  The machine recognises this and changes the UI for the gambler; and displays percentages of losses alongside testimonials given by the family.

Primary use case for the involve system is users that want to start a conversation between gamblers and their loved ones to get them into treatment.
<br><br>
The process begins before the pub. They get a notification from the involve portal – and the UI on the EGM changes. The UI shows testimonials on the screen and the amount lost. Feedback is sent to family in relation to where they are, how long the user has been there. This is based on the research that gamblers often gamble to hide their inner demons and repress feelings. When the problematic individual leaves the pub, the family get notified when they left, and are able to see the exact time and money spent. This keeps the conversation open, when they get home there is statistical evidence of their problem.
  </p>

    <h2> Why we didn’t follow through with this concept: </h2>
              <p>
The reason that the involve system wasn’t selected as a chosen space, was due to the lack of viability in the sense of governmental regulation industry regulation and the infringement of civil liberties, in other words: it breaches on our unnegotiable areas. If the device were to alter its UI, all pubs would need to implement this, or specific pubs would be disadvantaged. Likewise, the lack of complete understanding into when this problem can be identified causes conflict; the user may not believe they have a problem, but the family might, if the family restricts the user due to this.  This can be seen as an act against the civil liberties of the user and cause an area for manipulation. However, the concept of increased family communication was carried through into the final solution space. Increased visibility of problematic behaviour to the family, likewise, a direct chain of communication was updated into the final solution.

  <h2> But what is the Comm-it?</h2>
            <p>
The primary use case for the ‘com-it’ is for problematic individuals who want assistance regulating excessive spending. “Australian lose more money from gambling than any developed nation in the world.” (Sebag-Montefiore, 2017) Research has shown gamblers “continue to persist, even after suffering extreme financial loss” (Jazaeri, 2012). To  counteract this problem gambler Riana sets pre commitment levels, but as soon as she gets on the machine she breaks, because she becomes emerged – a concept called restoration.  Likewise, venues incentivise excessive spending by ensuring the users remain in their chair, comfortable. Thus, three problems are correlating. how can we implement restoration in a committal card and reduce comfort?
<br><br>
The com-it ideated on the problem but settled on the idea that took inspiration from the previous research report, specifically the interview with Jackie.
  </p>

    <h2> Why we didn’t follow through with this concept: </h2>
              <p>
The reason that the involve system wasn’t selected as a chosen space, was due to the lack of viability in the sense of governmental regulation industry regulation and the infringement of civil liberties, in other words: it breaches on our unnegotiable areas.

Increased visibility of problematic behaviour to the family, likewise, a direct chain of communication was updated into the final solution.


  </p>



    <h2> The Original User Journey </h2>
    <p> Two devices are at play: the problematic gambler uses the ‘com-it wearable’. The solution specifically relies on a wearable, as the concept is ‘a watch for income’, having a device so easily accessible increases visibility. The families: use the phone application. After they both activate their accounts, the problematic individual has to ask the family to transfer money onto his com-it, increasing the challenge of gambling and allowing for an open and collaborative discussion.
   <br><br>
  Once the money is transferred, it visually displays as a bar educating the user on income lost, rather than income gained. <span id= "strong_li"> “Bar graphs are the easiest form of graph to understand, and most effective at mapping changes over time.” (Lile, n.d.) </span> The problematic individual has to get cash out at the bar – this force the user too constantly leave the room increasing restoration and decreasing comfort. The bar drops, every time the user spends money. Once the limit has dropped below halfway the wearable will vibrate every 15 mins, this increases feedback, externalising to reduce memory load. At the same time a notification is sent to the family <span id= "strong_li"> “increasing cognition as information is salient” (Sharp et al, 2019). </span> Once the user has run out of money – they have to walk home to get more. forcing the user to leave the venue. If the problematic individual asks for a top-up nothing will happen, because the com-it locks all transfers for 24hrs. This forces them to find something else to do while they wait and minimises the risk of manipulation to gain more money. </p>

<h4> The Technology </h4>
  <p> The use of the Apple Watch was purposefully chosen as our technology. Our target demographic has a high concentration of elderly people. Due to this, increased accessibility was important. The Apple Watch is becoming free for our demographic in countries like America (Pierini, 2019). This is due to the Apple Watch having fall functions and being able to monitor heart rate. Due to this the elderly are more likely to buy an Apple Watch: 48% of baby boomers and 46% of Generation X, compared to 29% of Generation Z. (Lineaweaver, 2018)</p>
