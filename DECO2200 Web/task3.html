          <h2> Our Stakeholder Analysis </h2>
          <p> Each of our 3 reports heralded a wide variety of results. These results have heavily impacted our decision on the solutions that we could eventually design. We as a group investigated the factors which contribute to problem gambling,
            inquiring about the influence of the gambling machines themselves, the venue their held in and finally the mental characteristics.

        <div data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="100" class=report_content_grid_text>
          <h3> Structural </h3>
          <p> In terms of structural characteristics, we found that the two most important factors for problem gamblers are 'fast reel spins' and bright flashing lights and sounds as rewarding for any amount of money 'won' as the machine's own form
            of positive reinforcement. For people to be able to gamble alone and without these factors, they need to be able to have these two aspects from the machine they play. A high jackpot being present on a machine also entices people to play
            as they think it increases their likeliness of actually winning because "It has to go off sooner or later.'' Otherwise, even non-problem gamblers can also see gambling machines as 'fun' so a potential solution can be derived from trying
            to find a new source of 'fun', as some participants stated that they gamble because it's just an easy and thrilling activity to do.

          <h3> Venue </h3>
          <p> Following an extensive legal and policy review, we found that there was very little which could actually be altered in the physical problem location. There remain “non-negotiable areas” within these spaces such as government
            regulation, which regulate the current methods of displaying warnings and signage displays as well as other regulations such as (in the same act no less) of the darkness in the room. This means that the amalgam of governmental factors
            regulating the experience of gambling correlate with the enabling of gamblers to begin the road to addiction. There is also an inherent presence of alcohol in these gambling-enabled venues which contributes to addiction rates, as alcohol
            detriments the body’s ability to perform executive functions. The findings demonstrated a need for self-regulation. Self-regulation would be the basis for many of our concepts, as there are ‘negotiable areas’ within what a gambler can
            utilise to assist themselves with self-regulation.

          <h3> Psychological </h3>
          <p> Finally, we found that there are a wide array of psychological characteristics which govern whether a person is likely to be a problem gambler. Whether or not someone is likely to be able to get addicted to something, can be mapped on
            a spectrum. Problem gambling, similarly, also able to be mapped on a spectrum as there are 3 factors which characterise an individual’s own experience with pathological gambling. These are: their experiences, addictions and treatment.
            Other than this, there is no uniform definition for what ‘problem gambling’ entails, and currently only describes that an individual spends excess time and finance doing this activity. Solutions for these sorts of issues must be able to
            remove gambling as a support beacon for people with underlying, pre-existing psychological issues</p>

              setting aside findings that created unviable solution spaces e.g. law.
              We began finding correlations between different elements within our ideation, specifically in regard to commitment and spending, the involvement of families, and trying to get the user physically away from the environment itself.
              We converged our ideation, into three core solution areas: commitment, communication and alternatives.
              We used crazy eights to collaboratively build upon these areas to iterate and benefit future solutions. Independently we selected concept areas that we had increased research knowledge on.

            </blockquote>

          </section>

          <p> The involve system was based off research into communication – specifically addiction being a force that comes as a result of one’s own personality and internal/external factors. For example, imagine yourself as a gambler who gambles
            to hide personal thoughts - It’s only natural for people to rely on their friends and family to help them with something so personal
            <br><br>
            Gambling and addiction are intrinsically private. Problem Gamblers unknowingly distort the truth when they communicate their addiction - there is shame surrounding it. Everyone has a secret, though, you are only hurting yourself by
            lying. Problem gamblers need to communicate more freely and openly in order to seek help. If we can communicate without judgement, then treatment services can be quickly and easily accessed. This communication can lead to treatment. A
            combination of reduced shame, easy accessibility and honesty leads to increased likelihood of a problematic individual seeking treatment.

          </p>

          <h2> What is it? </h2>
          <p> The involve system starts better, honest and easier communication between gambler and family. The machine recognises this and changes the UI for the gambler; and displays percentages of losses alongside testimonials given by the
            family.

            Primary use case for the involve system is users that want to start a conversation between gamblers and their loved ones to get them into treatment.
            <br><br>
            The process begins before the pub. They get a notification from the involve portal – and the UI on the EGM changes. The UI shows testimonials on the screen and the amount lost. Feedback is sent to family in relation to where they are,
            how long the user has been there. This is based on the research that gamblers often gamble to hide their inner demons and repress feelings. When the problematic individual leaves the pub, the family get notified when they left, and are
            able to see the exact time and money spent. This keeps the conversation open, when they get home there is statistical evidence of their problem.
          </p>

          <h2> Why we didn’t follow through with this concept: </h2>
          <p>
            The reason that the involve system wasn’t selected as a chosen space, was due to the lack of viability in the sense of governmental regulation industry regulation and the infringement of civil liberties, in other words: it breaches on
            our unnegotiable areas. If the device were to alter its UI, all pubs would need to implement this, or specific pubs would be disadvantaged. Likewise, the lack of complete understanding into when this problem can be identified causes
            conflict; the user may not believe they have a problem, but the family might, if the family restricts the user due to this. This can be seen as an act against the civil liberties of the user and cause an area for manipulation. However,
            the concept of increased family communication was carried through into the final solution space. Increased visibility of problematic behaviour to the family, likewise, a direct chain of communication was updated into the final
            solution.

            <h2> But what is the Comm-it?</h2>
            <p>
              The primary use case for the ‘com-it’ is for problematic individuals who want assistance regulating excessive spending. “Australian lose more money from gambling than any developed nation in the world.” (Sebag-Montefiore, 2017)
              Research has shown gamblers “continue to persist, even after suffering extreme financial loss” (Jazaeri, 2012). To counteract this problem gambler Riana sets pre commitment levels, but as soon as she gets on the machine she breaks,
              because she becomes emerged – a concept called restoration. Likewise, venues incentivise excessive spending by ensuring the users remain in their chair, comfortable. Thus, three problems are correlating. how can we implement
              restoration in a committal card and reduce comfort?
              <br><br>
              The com-it ideated on the problem but settled on the idea that took inspiration from the previous research report, specifically the interview with Jackie.
            </p>

            <h2> Why we didn’t follow through with this concept: </h2>
            <p>
              The reason that the involve system wasn’t selected as a chosen space, was due to the lack of viability in the sense of governmental regulation industry regulation and the infringement of civil liberties, in other words: it breaches on

            </p>



            <h2> The Original User Journey </h2>
            <p> Two devices are at play: the problematic gambler uses the ‘com-it wearable’. The solution specifically relies on a wearable, as the concept is ‘a watch for income’, having a device so easily accessible increases visibility. The
              families: use the phone application. After they both activate their accounts, the problematic individual has to ask the family to transfer money onto his com-it, increasing the challenge of gambling and allowing for an open and
              collaborative discussion.
              <br><br>
              Once the money is transferred, it visually displays as a bar educating the user on income lost, rather than income gained. <span id="strong_li"> “Bar graphs are the easiest form of graph to understand, and most effective at mapping

                <h3> Why we chose it </h3>

                <h4> The Technology </h4>
                <p> Finally, we found that there are a wide array of psychological characteristics which govern whether a person is likely to be a problem gambler. Whether or not someone is likely to be able to get addicted to something, can be
                  mapped on a spectrum. Problem gambling, similarly, also able to be mapped on a spectrum as there are 3 factors which characterise an individual’s own experience with pathological gambling. These are: their experiences, addictions
                  and treatment. Other than this, there is no uniform definition for what ‘problem gambling’ entails, and currently only describes that an individual spends excess time and finance doing this activity. Solutions for these sorts of
                  issues must be able to remove gambling as a support beacon for people with underlying, pre-existing psychological issues</p>

                <h4> Non negotiable areas</h4>
                <p> The com-it doesn’t break any current industry or governmental regulation. The product itself can be implemented independently, without harming the stakeholders.

                  <h4> Criteria</h4>
                  <p> In theory the com-it meet our criteria as it allows the user to identify that they excessively spend. It allows the user to be educated and re-evaluate their problematic behaviour. It informs the user about their lack of
                    control but forfeiting control and allowing collaboration. Finally, it subsequently deters gambling due to increased challenge to partake in the activity itself, the benefit of which is reduced financial stress.

            <h2> The Problem </h2>
            <p> A precondition is that: users have to want help - or they will manipulate others to achieve their goals. <br> Multiple use cases were explored, determining multiple alternative flows where manipulation could be invoked from the
              problematic individual. <br> From the use case exploration it was clear the manipulation of the system was going to be a great concern for the outcome of the ‘Com-it’. Likewise, uptake of the Com-it, is likely to be relatively low due
              to the lack of user control and freedom.

          <h2> Our iteration strategy </h2>
          <p> Our strategy is to develop this product in the most time efficient way. Implementing “current state, the path to get there and future state” (Google for Startups, 2016).
            <br><br>
            Our testing implemented methods to gain qualiative and quanititave primary data, while the explorative stage allowed us to explore the feedback based off secondary solutions. This allows us to iterate based of research, rather then
            opinion. Exploration of our product iteration will categorising them into the innovation diagram: desirability ( “a desirable solution, one that your users need” (Orton, 2017)), feasibility (“building on your current operational
            capabilities” (Orton, 2017)) and viability (“a sustainable business model” (Orton, 2017)) If we meet all three areas, we have sustained the “ideal innovation process” (Orton, 2017).

          <h1 class=method_header> Employing our Methodologies </h1>


          <h2> Usability mix test: Think aloud/roleplay </h2>

          <div class=general_box_content>
            <p>
              <span id=strong_li> Aim: </span> The aim of mixed usability testing was to test our conceptual model against our user’s mental model, to understand if our design principle implementation was successful and where the core errors were.
              We implemented role-play to understand the usability in conjunction with conceptual application and think aloud to find out why the users are having issues.
            </p>
          </div>


          <h2> Methods: </h2>

          <br><br>
          <p><span id=strong_li> Usability test: </span> We begin by explaining what the concept is, though at no point do we explain to the user how to complete the task, as by doing so we would minimise the success of the testing. We ensured our
            abstract tasks broadened incrementally from low level tasks to high-level tasks. We ensured all aspects of the application and wearable were tested. A template was filled out based on completion, error, success, user satisfaction,
            general comments and solutions to their errors/unsatisfaction (template can be found in the appendix). <br><br>
            <span id=strong_li> Think-aloud:</span> The method allowed us to not only figure out where the errors were, by why. Throughout the iterations, think aloud’s provided key data in our problem of ‘clarity’, and allowed us to determine
            whether or not it was navigation clarity or the lack of conceptual information. However due to this method, the use of ‘reaction time’ in iteration two became unreliable.<br><br>
            <span id=strong_li>Roleplaying </span> was a method used to test the concept. As only the gambler could use the wearable, we couldn’t have one user test both devices. Therefore, one facilitator acted out what the corresponding persona
            would be doing. Our aim was to be provided with greater quality of data, specifically in relation to themes, as we could receive emotional reactions rather than formal evaluative responses. This is evident in the first iteration, as
            roleplaying revealed the conceptual flaw of our design – enabling aggression.<br><br>
          </p>



          <h2> Sample and recruitment </h2>
          <p> Six users were tested all three iterations. As research has shown that “The best results come from testing no more than 5 users” (Nielsen, 2000). All participants are either gamblers, or family members, ensuring the testing is viable
            to our target audience.

          <h2> Adapted Co Creation </h2>
          <p> Co-creation was adapted to suit our strategy. Rather than applying the original method, of sitting the user down and letting them design, we believed it would be more efficient to implement a co-creation element though out all
            aspects of the testing including ‘how would you solve it’ questions in the tasks that had errors (usability testing) and the criteria that had errors (survey). Users who provided larger solutions (e.g Nicola with the self-regulation
            feature), where tested twice, upholding the ‘comparative’ nature of this method. By only implementing this method with a small group, we ensured that the data was reliable, as new users wouldn’t have a large investment in the product
            as co-creation participants would. This allowed the user to be involved not only in the interface, but in the conceptual development. Upholding a human centred approach, whilst also being time and resource efficient.

          <h2> Heuristic evaluations </h2>
          <p> Heuristic evaluations were conducted throughout the design process. Heuristic participants increased alongside the increased development of the application, as usability testing gradually got better, the team decided it would be more
            reliable, in the later stages to gain more experienced feedback. At no stage to we gain direct peer heuristics as we likewise wanted to ensure reliability through minimising the risk of bias. Iteration three’s participants all have
            experience within the field, and weren’t direct peers, therefore risk was minimal. Heuristics were beneficial within our iteration, as this is the only method where our participants weren’t gamblers, therefore were able to analysis our
            product from an interface perspective rather than a conceptual perspective.

          From the presentation of our solution’s future directions of the original concept were discussed:
          <br><br>


          <span id=question_iteration> How can we reduce alcohol related violence? </span> <br><br>
          Solution:
          The Com-it was further developed to implement Alt-funs concept of relaxation – breaking the negative feedback loop through relaxation techniques of mindfulness. This was updated through a new breathing feature. It uses vibration to
          assist with breathing techniques. The function ‘pops-up’ if the wearable determines heart rate is too high (built in Apple Watch function), and the vibration increases suggesting breathing in, decreasing to suggest breathing out. <br><br>

          <span id=question_iteration> How can we make it more accessible for individuals who have been drinking?</span><br><br>
          Solution:
          The com-it removed many of the wearable functions, reducing it to bare minimum so users can use it while under the influence of alcohol. This applies the, 80/20 rule and flexibility usability trade off. <br><br>

          <span id=question_iteration> How can you reduce the commitment level over time? </span><br><br>

          Solution:
          There is a new overall limit, where users can reduce cash out limit and payment limit over time. This was an implementation suggested by our tutor. <br><br>

          <span id=question_iteration> How can you ensure users won’t break? </span><br><br>
          Solution:
          Through providing external regulation. The Com-it implemented multiple factors of the involve system, including increased communication with the loved one through a new messaging function, the viewing of past activity, time and date of
          gambling. All of which allow the family to be more involved, and provide them with more monitoring abilities that will assist the users to “not break”. <br><br>

          <h3> The Application </h3>
          <p> The application has 4 core functions ‘messages’, ‘transfer’, ‘activity’ and ‘limits’. We wanted to ensure a linear UI navigation for set up in both the wearable and application, while providing a circular navigation for the core
            product functionality, using the ‘homepage’ as the “primary navigation” (Chambers, n.d.) in both devices.
          </p>

        <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="100" class=report_content_grid_text>
          <h3> The Wearable </h3>
          <p> The wearable features 3 core functions ‘testimonials’, ‘cash out’ and ‘activity’. Notifications within the wearable specifically act as “Responsive navigation” (Chambers, n.d.), as the wearable constantly reacts to the applications
            actions, most of its navigation is subsequently triggered by the application. <br><br> Our goal was to create internal consistency within the application and the wearable, ensuring navigation can be transferable and concise.
            Therefore, the navigation is very similar, but the functionality is different.

        <p> Through testing, this perceived conceptual flow will be tested, specially weather or not users believe the navigation meets their mental model. For a more detailed breakdown, refer to the appendix (appendix 1) </p>

            <h3> Pagination </h3>
            <p> The ‘com-its’ interface goal was to “keep the interface simple” this was done by “avoiding unnecessary elements” ("User Interface Design Basics", 2019). The play of white space was suggested to improve focus, reiterating that
              “simplicity is a powerful alley” ("User Interface Design Basics", 2019). The use of dividing information allows the content to be spread out and “allows the user to go through the order of the content more efficiently” (Affairs,
              n.d.). Providing a “step by step information flow” based off page layout and page design. (Ivanova, n.d.).

            <h3> Bread Crumb Toggle </h3>
            <p> Pagination was assisted by the use of bread crumb toggles. This is specifically within the wearable, as it remains functional consistent with the Apple Watch. </p>

            <h3> Engagement </h3>
            <p> Our design implements adequate engagement as the call to action features, and navigational components remain at the bottom of the screen. This allows our device to be used more comfortably, and with one hand. </p>

            <h3> Notifications </h3>
            <p> Notifications are implemented as modal windows – forcing the user have to interact with the notification, rather than just ignoring it.

            <h3> Progress bar </h3>
            <p> The design features a bar graph, showing the amount of income left in the ‘Com-it’. The visual design on the application was inspired by Tesla, we wanted to ensure the visibility of system status of the wearable is clear and
              displayed is a minimalist aesthetic way. The progress bar “makes sure the system communicates what is happening” ("User Interface Design Basics", 2019), including the” action” of taking money, out and the “change in state” of the money
              left ("User Interface Design Basics", 2019). The constant feedback loop of the bar allows users to constantly be monitoring the progression of their limit.

            <h3> Message Boxes </h3>
            <p> The action of sending a message is displayed on the wearable as a message box. Then not only “provides information to the user”, but “requires them to take action before they can move forward” (Affairs, n.d.)

            <h3> Menus </h3>
            <p> The home page features a menu of actions in which can take place, these menus are vaguely based of the design of Hamburger menus – horizonal lines in which provide hierarchical information, this was to ensure a “clean” and
              “recognisable” design (Tran, 2019).

        <h2> Input </h2>


        <h3> Inspiration </h3>
        <p> Inspiration was taken from CommBank to ensure functional consistency with transactional input and output. The aim of which was to make it more intuitive to the user. (Logo, 2018). This further (in theory) adhered to the gulf of equation
          as we created “visual similarities” (Whitenton, 2018) between all of the com-it devices, and products that have similar system status designs such as Tesla. We likewise created “functional similarities” between all of the com-it devices,
          (Whitenton, 2018), and products that have similar systems such as CommBank.
        </p>

            <h3> Buttons </h3>
            <p>
              Buttons remain internally consistent. This creates allows the “consistency in layouts and design to facilitate efficiency” ("User Interface Design Basics", 2019). Allowing the user to feel “comfortable” as there is a “pattern in the
              language” ("User Interface Design Basics", 2019).

            <h3> List Boxes </h3>
            <p> The Bluetooth set up function implements list boxes, they are “compact and can support a longer list of options” (Affairs, n.d.).

            <h3> Text fields </h3>
            <p> The text fields “replicate common UI elements within other products” ("User Interface Design Basics", 2019). The application only allows a single line of text to be sent to the wearable, due to the screen size of the Apple Watch
              being too small for longer messages.

        <h2> Visual design </h2>

        <p> As a group we diverged our UI visual design, though we emphasised this part less as we wanted the visual design to be based of user feedback, rather then our own aesthetic option. We used design principles to be the basic of the design,
          allowing the form to follow the function. We used inspiration from similar products (CommBank and Tesla) and the original storyboard of the com-it, then ideated the designs.
        </p>

        <p> The final design implemented our design principles, however, to ensure more efficient usability and content discovery, we altered the header, and rearranged the elements based off the engagement diagram.

        </p>


        <h3> What we couldn’t develop this round: </h3>
        <p> <span id=strong_li> Colour and texture: </span> – Due to the prototype being low fidelity, colour and texture of the UI was not experimented with. In the future, colour has the ability to “draw and redirect attention” ("User Interface
          Design Basics", 2019) to important UI elements, specifically using contrast.
        </p>

        <p> <span id=strong_li> Typography </span> – Typography was not implemented due to the prototype being on paper. In the future typography can be used to create “hierarchy and increase readability” ("User Interface Design Basics", 2019).
        </p>

        <p> <span id=strong_li> Errors prevention </span> – This first test was important for the user to ‘break’ the system, we wanted to determine if our cognitive model was different to the user’s mental model, thus we will use testing to
          determine areas of the application in which there are increased errors and prevent them in future iterations.
        </p>

        <p> <span id=strong_li> Icons </span> – Icons are an important informational component, in which due to the lower fidelity we did not implement. Icons can be used to remove the amount of written data and create visual clarity.

        <h3>Wearable:</h3>
        <div class=general_box_content>
          <p> <span id = strong_li> Wearable Task 6 was the worst completed task on average with an average of 2.5 error rate, </span>  likewise the least satisfying task and had the worst success. Task 3 (cash out) has an average of 2.3 error rate and scored equal to task 6 on success. Task 2 (How much money have you been sent?) got an average of 1.5 error rate (Task 2). Task 1 (set up) had the overall worst completion. The average time was something we didn’t believe are reliable within this round as users ability to read the mock-up varied according to weather or not they could read handwriting. </p>
